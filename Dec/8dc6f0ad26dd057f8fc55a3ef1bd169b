Parliament, Wednesday, 4 December 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has postponed its meeting with South African Airways (SAA) that was scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday, 05 December 2019). The committee has taken this decision after the Chairperson of Scopa learnt that SAA is undergoing a process of voluntary business rescue.
	
	The committee welcomes this step and hopes that the process will assist the airline to receive the assistance it requires. The committee has been informed that this is the only viable route to avoid an uncontrolled implosion of the national airline. Scopa is made to understand that an Administrator will move in and the Board will effectively not be in charge.
	
	As this unfolds at the airline, Scopa will follow the Parliamentary process closely and will work with the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises when it is necessary. The committee will now afford the airline and shareholder the space and time to finalise the processes of this cause of action of business rescue. After the completion of its own processes of consultation, the committee will meet with the airline and the shareholder.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
