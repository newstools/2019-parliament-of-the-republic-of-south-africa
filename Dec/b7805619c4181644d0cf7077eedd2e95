Parliament, Wednesday, 4 December 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) will tomorrow (Thursday, 5 December 2019) conduct an oversight visit to South African Airways (SAA). Scopa held a hearing with SAA on 13 November 2019 regarding the non-tabling of annual financial statements by SAA.
	
	The committee agreed on 13 November 2019 that a roadmap for the submission of the financial statements would be presented to Scopa on 27 November 2019. The committee never received the roadmap and all the documents it had requested SAA to submit.
	
	The committee’s aim for conducting the oversight to SAA is to assess the extent to which the weaknesses in the internal controls due to management policies and procedures not adequately followed are. Scopa also wants to establish the root of continued non-compliance and the breach of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and it wants to establish the cause and nature of weak internal controls and financial controls.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
