Parliament, Saturday, 14 December 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Tourism, Mr Supra Mahumapelo commends the departments of tourism and police for their joint initiative and intervention plan on tourism safety especially during the festive season.
	
	"We are happy because this sends a clear message to both domestic and international tourists that they must feel safe and enjoy their holidays in South Africa," said Mr Mahumapelo.
	At the same time, Mr Mahumapelo notes the outcome of the hearing which did not find the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the South African Tourism guilty. "We hope this brings the matter relating to the CEO and which was reported to us by the Department of Tourism in June, to an end. We are looking forward to the engagement with the Board and the department on this matter so that our total focus can be on tourism as it is an important contributor to the economy of South Africa to end poverty and create jobs.
