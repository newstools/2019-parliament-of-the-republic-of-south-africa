Parliament, Sunday, 8 December 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has congratulated the Springboks Sevens team, “Blitzboks” for winning the Dubai leg of the current series. The Blitzboks beat New Zealand 15 to win the opening leg of the World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai yesterday. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlalane said, South Africa (SA) dominated the Dubai leg of the current series from the word go, and defeated New Zealand in the final competition. “This domination demonstrates SA’s prowess in all forms of rugby, and this became clear after that successful tournament of the 15s that the Springboks won in a majestic style in Japan last month,” added Ms Beauty Dlulane. The committee is encouraged by these championship teams that reflect the South African demographics. According to the committee, the frequency of wins justify its call for the acceleration of transformation in rugby. Ms Dlulane has also called for more attention to be paid on women’s team, especially on the improvement of its competitive edge. The series moves to Cape Town next weekend.
