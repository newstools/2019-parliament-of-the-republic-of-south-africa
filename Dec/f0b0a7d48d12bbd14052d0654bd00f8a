Parliament, Tuesday, 24 December 2019 â€“ The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo, wish all Christians a joyful, peaceful and heavenly blessed Christmas period. Christmas is among the significant days marked on the Christian calendar and a period driven by the spirit of caring, believing, love and giving, as part of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. The Presiding Officers call on all South Africans to make use of this time to extend a hand of kindness, giving and caring to those who are less fortunate. This period is among others, largely characterised by high traffic volumes in different roads of South Africa. As we travel to various destinations to spend time with our loved ones, the Presiding Officers urge all road users to exercise caution. Presiding Officers further urge everyone to take responsibility for ensuring a safe environment, a peaceful and a memorable festive season for all of us. The Presiding Officers also commend all workers who are working day and night during this period, such as those responsible for enforcing law and order in our streets, ensuring safety on our roads and saving lives at various healthcare centres. May you all enjoy this well-deserved rest, re-energise and return in 2020 ready for another critical milestone in our collective and continuous effort to build a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, united and prosperous South Africa.
