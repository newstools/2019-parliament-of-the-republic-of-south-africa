Parliament, Thursday, 12 December 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans (National Assembly) invites stakeholders and interested parties to make written submissions on the Defence Amendment Bill [B18 - 2017]. The Objective of the Bill is to align the Defence Act (No. 42 of 2002) with current Departmental organisational requirements to enhance the efficiency of the Department of Defence. While the Bill was passed in the National Assembly (NA) on 11 November 2018, subsequent changes to section 103 (1) by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) resulted in the Bill being sent back to the NA. The amendments suggested the number of days of absence of a Member in section 59(3) must be linked to the number of days in section 103 (1), that is, exceeding 10 continuous calendar days of absence. The Bill, in terms of Rules 333 and Rules 351 lapsed on the last sitting day of the Fifth Parliament, and was revived by the National Assembly on 29 October 2019, following a resolution to resume the proceeding from the stage that they were referred to the relevant committees of the Assembly for consideration and report (Order Paper: National Assembly No 25–2019). Public hearings will be conducted in Parliament by the Committee on a date yet to be determined. The closing date to make written submissions and indications to make oral submissions is at 16:00 on Friday, 24 January 2020. Submissions must be directed to the Committee Secretary, Mr B Mantyi, 3rd Floor, 90 Plein Street, Cape Town, 8000 or bmantyi@parliament.gov.za / or tel. (021) 403-3796 or fax: 086 760 6485.
