Parliament, Wednesday, 4 December 2019 – The Sub-Committee of the Joint Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, and the Select Committee on Health and Social Services have learnt that the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) working draft advert has been leaked and circulated within the public domain. Chairpersons for the sub-committee said no official advert has been published in the media by the committee. What is in the public domain and being circulated is not an official advert, as the sub-committee is still busy drafting the official advert. The sub-committee said it is disappointed and concerned about the unofficial advert that has surfaced in the public domain. The sub-committee said it’s of the view that the unofficial advert will create an adverse view on the credibility of the process. The sub-committee agreed that applications and nominations that have been received will not be taken into consideration as the process calling for nominations has not started. Only applications received within the duration of the recruitment process will be considered by the sub-committee. The sub-committee will communicate its proper process in due course.
