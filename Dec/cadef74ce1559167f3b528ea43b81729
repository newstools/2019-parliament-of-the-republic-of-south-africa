Parliament, Tuesday, 3 December 2019 –The Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities notes the report on the investigation that was conducted by Bishops Diocesan School in Cape Town about a former educator having resigned amidst allegations of a relationship with an 18-year-old pupil on October 11.
	
	The school later announced that several more pupils may have been involved. One of the main findings of the report revealed that “during the period 2013 to 2019, and whilst employed as a teacher at the school, she engaged in sexual misconduct with at least five pupils”.
	
	The committee acknowledges Headmaster Pearson’s response to the report in that "the school will consider all findings and recommendations made by the investigators to ensure that we continue to make Bishops a safe environment for all our pupils and teachers".
	
	Committee Chairperson, Ms Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba, said: “The safety of all learners in our schools is important, and this includes the boy child. We urge the Commission for Gender Equality to take heed of this case and monitor the outcomes of the findings as these have wide-ranging implications across the country.
	
	Ms Ncube-Ndaba also said: “The Commission for Gender Equality should engage with the Department of Basic Education and the South African Council of Educators about sexual misconduct in schools perpetrated by educators.”
