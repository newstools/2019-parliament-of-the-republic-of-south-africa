Parliament, Monday, 9 December 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) welcomes the dissolution of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa’s) Interim Board and also welcomes the move to place Prasa under administration.
	
	Following the hearing Scopa has held with Prasa on 20 November 2019 as a result of the disclaimed audit opinion the entity received for the 2018/19 financial year, which was a regression from prior years, it became clear that the Interim Board was failing on accountability and bringing stability in the entity.
	
	During the hearing with the now dissolved Interim Board, it became clear that the root causes of the challenges plaguing Prasa were not being dealt with. Scopa believes that the decision taken by the Minister of Transport to place Prasa under administration is the first step towards bringing stability at the Agency.
	
	Scopa commends the urgency in which the Minister of Transport dealt with this matter, and will continue to monitor closely the performance of the Administrator as it deals with the issues that are plaguing the agency. Furthermore, Scopa would like to see the governance situation turned around at Prasa and wishes the Administrator well as it begins its work.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
