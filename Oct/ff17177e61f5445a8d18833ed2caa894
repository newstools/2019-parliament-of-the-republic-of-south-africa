Parliament, Friday, 18 October 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, on behalf of the committee, has welcomed the National Electricity Infrastructure Development Plan, which was announced this morning by Minister Gwede Mantashe.
	
	Mr Luzipo said that the plan could not have come at a better time, now that the country is on the path to economic recovery. He believes strongly that its success will depend largely on a well-functioning Eskom, which should be putting in place high technology maintenance systems in line with the fourth industrial revolution.
	
	“The committee will in its next meeting consider a suitable date upon which Minister Mantashe will be invited to make a full presentation on the details of the plan and how it will be implemented. I hope the plan consists of immediate interventions to address the energy challenges, which are characterised by the current stage 2 and 1 load shedding nationally” said Mr Luzipo.
	
	Mr Luzipo further noted the ongoing process to finalise the Special Appropriation Bill, which is aimed at providing R59 billion financial relieve to Eskom. “Although we discourage perpetual government bailouts, we remain confident that the Bill will be adopted by both Houses of Parliament,” said Mr Luzipo.
