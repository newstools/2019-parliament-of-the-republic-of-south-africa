Parliament, Monday, 14 October 2019 – The Standing Committee on Appropriation (SCOA) will embark on a three-day oversight visit to Eskom in the Gauteng Province, from Monday, 14 October, to Wednesday, 16 October 2019. The purpose of the visit is to engage with Eskom’s management and organised labour with a view to addressing the instability, weak governance, non-compliance with procurement prescripts, liquidity constraints and cost escalations due to delays and design defects in capital projects. The committee is also to receive a briefing from the Auditor-General South Africa (AGSA) relating to Eskom’s key financial matters for the past five years. The oversight follows the adoption of the committee’s report on the Special Appropriations Bill [B10-2019], and the call for National Treasury to impose more stringent conditions to the R59 billion support to be provided to Eskom.
