Parliament, Tuesday, 29 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy has welcomed a presentation by Minister Gwede Mantashe on the Cabinet approved Integrated Resource Plan 2019 (IRP 2019). It further appreciated the IRP 2019 as a long-overdue strategic document needed in order to provide a plan for the country’s future electricity generation.
	
	The IRP is a legal instrument contemplated under the Electricity Regulation Act. The first plan for the country was referred to as the IRP 2010 and was promulgated in 2011. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, said that economic growth and stability with job creation objectives should be placed at the centre of developing government plans.
	
	“Long-term plans usually requires a huge capital investment and our view is that such investment should result in economic growth and job creation. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy should come back to brief the committee on the international projects, including, among others, the Grand Inga Hydropower and South Sudan Oil prospecting,” said Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	The committee raised a concern with the possible future plans to decommission the three coal-fired power stations in Hendrina, Komati and Grootvlei. It said the move could create economic stagnation in the nearby towns.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY, MR SAHLULELE LUZIPO.
