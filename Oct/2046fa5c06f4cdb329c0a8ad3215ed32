Parliament, Wednesday, 30 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services today adopted the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) Amendment Bill which provides for the recording of funding of political parties. In terms of recording, preservation and disclosure of records on the private funding of political parties, the Bill gives an obligation to the head of a political party (which is defined to include an independent candidate) to create and keep records of any donation exceeding the prescribed threshold, that has been made to that political party in any given financial year, the identity of the persons or entities who made such donations, make the records available on a quarterly basis, as prescribed and keep the records for a period of at least five years after the records concerned have been created. The “prescribed threshold” means the prescribed threshold contemplated in section 9(1)(a) of the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act No. 6 of 2018)”. Committee Chairperson, Mr Bulelani Magwanishe, said the committee ensured in the Bill that it provides for any registered political party as defined in the Electoral Act, irrespective of whether it has representation in the national, provincial or local government, to keep records and provide such records. Mr Magwanishe said: “All submissions, irrespective of oral or written, were taken into account. The Bill will likely be debated by the National Assembly on Tuesday.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES, MR BULELANI MAGWANISHE.
