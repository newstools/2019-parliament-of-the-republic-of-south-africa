Parliament, Thursday, 10 October 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson, has noted worrying media reports of systemic statistical manipulation and cover-ups of police criminality by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). As a result, the committee today resolved to ask Ipid for a comprehensive briefing on Ipid’s investigation into the matter. This will take place on 23 October 2019.
	
	The committee is concerned that such insinuations, if correct, undermine Ipid’s legislative role and its mandate of protecting the public against the police.
	
	Following the meeting on 23 October, a proper determination, followed by appropriate recommendations will be made. The committee is averse to making judgement calls before receiving first-hand information on the matter. Nonetheless, the committee views these reports in a serious light and has committed to getting to the bottom of the matter.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON POLICE, MS TINA JOEMAT-PETTERSSON.
