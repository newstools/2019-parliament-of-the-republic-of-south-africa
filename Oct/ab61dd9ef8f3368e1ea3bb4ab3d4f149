Parliament, Wednesday, 23 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services today resolved to refer the complaints regarding the head of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) that have been brought to its attention, to the Minister of Justice and Correctional Service to urgently investigate the allegations. Committee Chairperson, Mr Bulelani Magwanishe, said the matter will be referred to Minister Ronald Lamola today. “We will inform the Minister that the matter is very urgent and that there should be an expeditious investigation. Furthermore, we would require a report on this matter when we return to Parliament early in the new year,” said Mr Magwanishe. The committee has received a letter of complaint against the management style of Adv Andy Mothibe regarding a “gross abuse of power and abuse of SIU resources by Adv Mothibi to conceal sexual harassment tendencies and the victimisation of women employees”. Mr Magwanishe said: “The SIU is very important in the fight against corruption and we cannot allow it to be destabilised.” The committee will engage with the Minister at the first possible opportunity in January 2020.
