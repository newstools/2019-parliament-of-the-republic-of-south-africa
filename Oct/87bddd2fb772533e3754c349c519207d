Parliament, Monday, 14 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications will tomorrow be briefed on the annual financial and performance report of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) for the 2018/19 financial year. In the year under review, the committee was briefed about the financial challenges faced by the SABC, in which, through the Department of Communications, the public broadcaster then requested a financial relieve of R3.2 billion from the National Treasury. The committee supported this move. The SABC, however, only received a financial relief of R2.1 billion in the 2019/20 financial year. The remaining R1.1 billion will be transferred after the SABC has met in full all the conditions set out by the National Treasury. The committee has acknowledged the cooperation between SABC, the Department of Communications and National Treasury and, expressed confidence that all the conditions will be met. Meanwhile, the committee will be briefed further on the annual reports of the other nine entities reporting to the Department of Communications as well as the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa. The entities are Sentech, State Information Technology Agency, Broadband Infranco, Universal Service Access Agency of South Africa, Universal Service Access Fund, South African Post Office, .ZADNA, National Electronic Media Institute of South Africa and, Films and Publications Board.
