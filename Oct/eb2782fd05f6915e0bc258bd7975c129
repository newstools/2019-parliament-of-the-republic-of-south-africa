Parliament, Thursday, 24 October 2019 – The National Council of Provinces’ (NCOP’s) select committees, the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic and Business Development, Small Business Development, Tourism, Employment and Labour – and the Select Committee on Transport, Public Service and Administrations, Public Works and Infrastructure have welcomed the thousands of jobs to be created by the R10 billion capital expenditure projects to be implemented by the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA).
	
	The projects will create thousands of jobs in the built and construction environments over the next five years. Although satisfied with progress made towards implementing these projects, members cautioned ACSA to ensure that it adheres to proper project management principles and target completion dates. Committee members heard that despite global, regional and national challenges, ACSA has remained one of the most profitable state-owned enterprises.
	
	The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic and Business Development, Small Business Development, Tourism, Employment and Labour, Mr Mandla Rayi, and the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Transport, Public Service and Administration, Public Works and Infrastructure, Mr Kenneth Mmoeimang, confirmed to the ACSA management that they will ask the Minister of Transport to explain the delay in appointing the company's Chief Executive Officer.
	This follows the finalisation of the selection process and the submission of the name of the successful candidate earlier this year. The Minister is expected to report to the committee within the next two weeks.
