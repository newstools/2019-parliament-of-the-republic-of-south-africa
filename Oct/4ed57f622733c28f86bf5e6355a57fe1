Parliament, Tuesday, 22 October 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has adjourned its meeting before it even started, due to non-attendance of the Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) though the committee received confirmation of attendance of the Chairperson.
	
	Today Scopa expected a briefing from the IMTT and the committee is very disappointed that none of the IMTT members were present at today’s meeting. What is also disappointing is that even last night the Chairperson of the IMTT had indicated that they will be in the meeting, but requested to leave early, therefore it is very concerning that the committee is informed of the apology at the meeting.
	
	This afternoon, Parliament will be dealing with Eskom’s Special Appropriation Bill, the Bill which indicates the seriousness with which the Eskom matter is taken by the country. Municipalities have contributed tremendously to the financial challenges that face Eskom by not paying the utility, and that results in the huge debt owed to Eskom by municipalities.
	
	An intervention was put in place to deal with the problem between Eskom and Municipalities. Scopa has the responsibility of keeping the IMTT accountable on how the intervention is going. It is important for the country to know the progress IMTT is making.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
