Parliament, Thursday, 10 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education today expressed its support and appreciation for the hard work done thus far in relation to the examination readiness by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to administer the 2019 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations.
	
	The committee today received a briefing from the DBE, and said it has confidence that the examination systems are ready to administer a successful examination.
	
	The committee heard that in 2019, 790 405 candidates will sit for this year’s NSC examination across 7416 examination centres. This includes 620 871 full-time candidates and 169 534 part-time candidates. The DBE as the public assessment body must ensure that the examinations are credible to ensure currency of the certificate.
	
	A total of 147 examination question papers for the 2019 November examination have been set and externally moderated by Umalusi. Examination papers set for May/June 2020 are already set up and will be used in the event of a compromise. Quality assurance (editing and proofreading) is completed and QPs handed over to PEDs in two consignments; 16 August 2019 and 16 September 2019.
	
	The committee further heard that the DBE facilitated several extra classes like Winter classes and Spring classes in an attempt to support the class of 2019. Committee Chairperson, Ms Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba, applauded the DBE for the continued support given to matrics. “This is especially needed in our less fortunate communities. However, the department should at some time consider to introduce such initiatives at lower grades like from Grade 8.”
	
	The department noted several generic risks cutting across all PEDs that need to be addressed jointly by the DBE and the nine PEDs. These includes service delivery/community protests, security of question papers across the system, inadequate monitoring of NSC examinations, inadequate staff capacity and Senior Certificate candidates writing the November NSC examination. Contingency plans have been put in place for all risks identified.
	
	The committee heard that the Minister of Basic Education will announce the results for the class of 2019 on 7 January 2020.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON BASIC EDUCATION, MS BONGIWE MBINQO-GIGABA.
