Parliament, Tuesday, 22 October 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, has congratulated Major-General Zola Dabula on his appointment as the new Surgeon-General of the South African Military Health Service (SAMHS). “We are confident that his contribution will add to contributions that have been made by previous surgeons-general that have come before him. We congratulate him and we are looking forward to seeing a process of strengthening the National Health Insurance (NHI) and related health programmes in the country. The military is doing its best in taking care of our citizens, and we wish Major-General Dabula well in his new role,” said Dr Dhlomo. Major-General Dabula’s advocacy for health started in the 1980s, where he contributed to the building of the democratic health movement. During the time of his training as a medical doctor at the University of Natal’s black section, he continued with his desire to strengthen health services in the country as a doctor working in Mthatha, and proceeding right up to becoming a medical officer in the South African Military Health Service. He was harassed by the security police during the apartheid dispensation for building the underground pillar of struggle for the African National Congress. His three decades of military health experience, including serving as a physician to the late former President Nelson Mandela, is a testimony to his proven expertise Dr Dhlomo said: “We also want to thank the outgoing Surgeon-General, Aubrey Sedibe, for doing an excellent job in his time at the SAMHS.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, DR SIBONGISENI DHLOMO.
