Parliament, Wednesday, 16 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has noted with grave concern the load shedding announcement made by Eskom today, especially in light of learners doing their 2019 practical Computer Applications Technology (CAT) National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations.
	
	Committee Chairperson, Ms Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba, said: “This is a cause for concern because CAT is a practical examination that is done on a computer. We would like to appeal to Eskom to be cognisant of this fact when decisions of load shedding are made and implemented.”
	
	On Thursday registered learners will do their Information Technology practical examinations. It has been reported that load shedding affected matric learners at some centres. “The NSC examinations are normally a very stressful period for our young people. When something like this happens and the examination must be halted, only to be continued when the electricity supply is restored, it can add to more stress,” said Ms Mbinqo-Gigaba.
	
	The committee has noted comments by the Department of Basic Education that it will look into the possibility of engaging Eskom with a view to alerting it to the negative effect the power cuts may have on the national exams. The committee is encouraged by the fact that the DBE has a backup exam which can be scheduled if there are candidates who are not able to write this exam.
