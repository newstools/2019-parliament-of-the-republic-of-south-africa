Parliament, Thursday, 10 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology welcomes the arrest of the three employees who are alleged to have committed fraud relating to diverting student allowances to their personal accounts, as was confirmed by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) on 9 October 2019. The committee notes with grave concern the diversion for personal benefit, of the investment made by the government for the realisation of the constitutionally enshrined right, to make further education accessible and available to young people from poor working-class families. “The committee takes a zero tolerance stand to fraudulent and corrupt activities, especially when investment is made towards expanding access to education and training for the historically disadvantaged people, to enable our country to produce a skilled and capable workforce to drive economic growth and to eradicate poverty, narrow inequality and create employment,” said the Chairperson of the committee, Mr Phill Mapulane. Mr Mapulane said: “We applaud the NSFAS Administrator for instituting forensic investigations to get to the bottom of corruption that took place at the scheme, and we urge the Administrator that no stone should be left unturned to ensure that the stolen money is recovered. “The committee will continue to monitor progress in this regard and will also urge NSFAS to strengthen its internal controls to ensure that there is no recurrence of this incident, and we will at the earliest convenient time engage with NSFAS on other matters relating to the strengthening of the entity to deliver on its mandate.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, MR PHILLY MAPULANE.
