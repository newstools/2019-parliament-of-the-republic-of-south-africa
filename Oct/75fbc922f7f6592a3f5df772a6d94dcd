Parliament, Friday, 18 October 2019 – The Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee to Initiate and Introduce Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution today reaffirmed the committee’s commitment to meet the deadline prescribed by Parliament. Committee Chairperson Dr Mathole Motshekga said after the meeting that in order to observe the principle that South Africa’s constitutional democracy is both representative and participatory, the committee shall ensure that the people of South Africa are afforded the right to make their input on the draft Bill. “We affirm that in line with this, the committee reaffirms that it does not have a monopoly on wisdom and will involve local and international experts in its work,” he said. Dr Motshekga reiterated that a preparatory workshop will take place next month. Furthermore, the committee will endeavour to meet until the middle of December in order to ensure it meets the deadline and at the same time speed up the process. The committee agreed that the public hearings that took place during the fifth administration of Parliament that were mandated to investigate the desirability or otherwise of the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution should not diminish the committee’s commitment to sufficient and inclusive public hearings. “We shall also aim to ensure the full participation of political parties, however small, to ensure that as many Members of Parliament participate in the process,” Dr Motshekga said. The committee is committed to finalise its work by the deadline of 31 March 2020.
