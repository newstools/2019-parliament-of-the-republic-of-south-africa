Parliament, Monday, 14 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) will over the next two days continue with its visit to municipalities in Limpopo province to ascertain the state of service delivery in those municipalities.
	
	Of major focus will be municipalities that invested in the Venda Mutual Bank (VBS) and those municipalities that have received repeated disclaimer audit opinions. The objective of these interactions are to ascertain the impact of the investments on those municipalities, amounts invested, amounts recovered and what consequence management actions have been taken against relevant officials involved and the impact on the municipalities capacity to deliver services.
	
	Following the engagements with municipalities, the committee will hold public meetings with stakeholders including traditional leaders, ward councillors, civic organisations and ratepayers’ associations to get first-hand experiences on the impact of the investments on overall service delivery.
