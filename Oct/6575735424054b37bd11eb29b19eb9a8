Parliament, Tuesday, 22 October 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Health will this week, 25 – 28 October, start its first round of public hearings in Mpumalanga on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill. The NHI Bill was referred to the committee on 8 August 2019 by the Speaker of the National Assembly (NA) and after that, on 29 August 2019, the committee was briefed by the Department of Health on the Bill. The objective of the Bill is to achieve universal access to quality health care services in South Africa in accordance with section 27 of the Constitution, to establish a National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and to set out its powers, functions and governance structures, and to provide a framework for the strategic purchasing of health care services by the Fund on behalf of users. The Bill further aims to create mechanisms for equitable, effective and efficient utilisation of the resources of the Fund to meet the health needs of the population, to preclude or limit undesirable, unethical and unlawful practices in relation to the Fund and its users, and to provide for matters connected herewith. The committee Chairperson, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “There is a need to reform both healthcare funding and service delivery systems so that all South Africans have access to affordable, quality health-care services regardless of socio-economic status.” Dr Dhlomo said the main problem relates to fragmentation of the health care fund pools in the South African health system, and the aim is to create an integrated pool in order to achieve universal healthcare coverage for health care services by establishing a purchaser-provider split with the NHIF being the single-payer for comprehensive health care services purchased on behalf of the users. The committee called for written submissions from the public on the Bill at the beginning of September 2019, and the closing date for the submissions is 29 November 2019. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7nq0bSpzEA Attached is the programme for public hearings in Mpumalanga
