Parliament, Wednesday, 16 October 2019 – The Chairpersons of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee today announced that the committee will meet on Friday, 25 October 2019 to discuss its programme of action.
	
	Co-Chairperson of the Committee, Dr Mathole Motshekga said the agenda will be to look at the domestication of Kiswahili. “This is one of the official languages of the African Union. The Southern African Development Community Heads of state also indicated that this step should be taken.”
	
	He said Parliament had previously urged the Pan African Parliament on this matter. “We want to show that we are taking the initiative as we feel there might be a communication barrier that could be overcome with the domestication of Kiswahili.”
	
	Co-Chairperson, Mr Enock Mthethwa, said the issue of the South African Sign Language and Khelovelodu will also feature on the agenda. According to him, President Cyril Ramaphosa had previously announced that such recognition is needed.
