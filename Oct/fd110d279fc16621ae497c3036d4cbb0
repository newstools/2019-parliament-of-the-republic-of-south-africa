Parliament, Monday, 21 October 2019 – The Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) and the Select Committee on Security and Justice will this week perform a joint oversight in Limpopo province. The Select Committee on CoGTA will visit a number of municipalities, including the Vhembe District Municipality and the Musian and Makhado Local Municipalities. The purpose of the oversight is to interact with internal and external stakeholders of the municipalities as a means of monitoring the progress of the 2017/18 municipal audit outcomes, and the audit outcome action plans developed by the district and local municipalities. Meanwhile, the Select Committee on Security and Justice, which has the responsibility of ensuring accountability for the implementation of security and justice-related strategies, will visit a number of institutions, including the Thohoyandou Police Station. These will include, among other things, an inspection of the station’s safety operations to reduce crime, the prioritisation of sexual offences and the inspection of victim-friendly rooms.
