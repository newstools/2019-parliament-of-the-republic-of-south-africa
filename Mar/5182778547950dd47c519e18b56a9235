Parliament, Friday, 01 March 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Social Development has emphasised the need for the establishment of psychological and social services in schools around the country to assist in mitigating the social challenges affecting learners, which can lead to violence and other social ills. The committee believes that social workers should be available in schools to look after the psychological development of learners, particularly to help learners deal with the pressures they experience when they are away from their parents. The committee believes that it is important for all the relevant government departments to work together to ensure the provision of psychological services to learners in schools, as this will further student development. The committee also joins the nation in condemning the killing of the youth in our communities. The brutal killing of Mr Thoriso Themane by a group of school children in Polokwane in Limpopo earlier this week has shocked everyone. The committee would like to offer its sympathies to the family of Mr Themane and wishes the family strength during this time.
