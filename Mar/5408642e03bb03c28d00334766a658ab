Parliament, Monday, 4 March 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has welcomed the overall decline in mining fatalities in 2018. On Friday, 1 March 2019, the Department of Mineral Resources announced at a press briefing in Pretoria that 81 fatalities were recorded in 2018, compared to 90 in 2017. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, encouraged the department to work closely with all stakeholders, including mine management, workers and organised labour, to share the mechanisms that yielded positive results in 2018. Mr Luzipo said that although more funding is still needed for the department to carry out adequate inspections, the positive results could be attributed to the stability in administration, brought about by filling critical vacant positions. The committee has reiterated a call for mining companies to put more investment in research and development. “Meanwhile, the committee is still of the view that there should be a legislated way to impose punitive measures on companies that fail to put mechanisms in place to prevent fatalities in their operations,” said Mr Luzipo.
