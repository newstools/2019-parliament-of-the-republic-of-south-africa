Parliament, Tuesday, 19 March 2019 – The Select Committee on Land and Mineral Resources has adopted reports on the ratification of two treaties on the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer to include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCS), and the Southern African Development Communities (SADC) Protocol on Environment for Sustainable Development. Five provinces voted in favour, including Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and North West. The treaties were forwarded to the committee for consideration and approval on 24 January 2019. The committee also adopted a report on the Electronic Deeds Registration Systems Bill, which was referred to the committee for processing on 13 November 2018. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Olifile Sefako, said: “We considered the principle of passing the Bill as far too important to be delayed due to an issue of a technical nature, which could be fixed through a technical amendment by the department.” The committee has noted and extensively deliberated on the proposed definition of a “Statutory Officer” and agreed that the definition would add value in clarifying potential confusion in the interpretation of the Act. “Although holding a view that the definition is key, the committee has, however, found that the amendment was of a technical nature which could not be allowed to delay the passing of the Bill,” said Mr Sefako. The committee was meeting for the last time in the fifth term of Parliament.
