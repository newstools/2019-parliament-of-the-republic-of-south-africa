Parliament, Wednesday, 20 March 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture welcomes the arrest of the Living Legends Legacy Trust (LLLP) Chairman, Mr Themba Msomi, who is believed to be linked to the theft of R8 million from the LLLP account earlier this year. The committee is disheartened by the news that the crime may have been committed by someone who is supposed to understand artists’ struggles and the dire need for this money in the arts industry. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Xoliswa Tom, reiterated her earlier statement that this is highly unethical behaviour. These types of incidents deprive a new generation of artists, who may have benefitted from investment in various arts programmes. Mr Msomi is well known as the founder of Izulu Dance Theatre in Durban and for his contribution to the arts industry. He was arrested by the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation’s serious commercial crime unit on the weekend.
