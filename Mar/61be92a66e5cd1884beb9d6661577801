Meanwhile, the committee was also briefed by the Minister of Communications, Ms Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, on the state of the department and its entities, in which she highlighted the challenge of capacity constraints. She said there are nine funded vacant positions, including, among others, Director-General, Chief Director for Entity Oversight and Director for Cabinet Support. However, the Minister has put a moratorium on filling all vacant positions in the department and entities. “We thank the department for putting together a comprehensive presentation at short notice and putting together a team that is focussing on the merger between the Department of Communications and the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services,” said Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, the Chairperson of the Committee.
