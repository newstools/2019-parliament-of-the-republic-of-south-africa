Parliament, Tuesday, 26 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation has called on corporate South Africa to help support Banyana Banyana’s 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup campaign. The committee heard during a presentation from the South African Football Association (Safa) on Tuesday that R20 million has been budgeted for the entire campaign. The World Cup is scheduled to take place in France between 7 June and 7 July 2019. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, welcomed Safa’s investment in women’s football, but said it needs to be supplemented. “Corporate South Africa and private businesses need to avail financial resources and support Banyana Banyana. Success is cultivated and funded, which is where the women’s game seems to be lacking,” Ms Dlulane said. Sponsorship of the women’s football team cannot remain at current low levels, especially given its success under the current management, led by coach Ms Desiree Ellis, Ms Dlulane said. “Banyana Banyana should not go to France just to add numbers; they must go there to compete and that warrants that they be supported in whatever way to make their campaign a success,” she said. Safa outlined the team’s preparations for the World Cup, including a series of friendly games scheduled to take place between Banyana Banyana and other World Cup teams, including The Netherlands, Finland and Jamaica. Safa also said that it planned to bid to host the 2023 event.
