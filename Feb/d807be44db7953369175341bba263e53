Parliament, Friday, 22 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Police has received the written submissions it requested from the Minister of Police, the Executive Director of Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and two amici curiae to deal with the matter of the renewal of the contract of the Executive Director of IPID as per the court order granted by the North Gauteng High Court. To ensure that the process is substantially and procedurally fair, the committee has resolved to reconvene on Monday 25 February 2019 to give Members of Parliament time to familiarise themselves with the opinions contained in all the submissions. Some of the documents were only received yesterday evening. Furthermore, the committee has requested further information, such as performance contracts, performance assessments and the security clearance of the current Head of IPID from the Minister and the Executive Director by end of business day today to enable the committee to make an informed decision. The committee welcomes and appreciates the submissions from the Helen Suzman Foundation and Corruption Watch. The HSF has in its submission raised that they intend taking the court order under review. While the committee appreciated the fact that the foundation is well within its right to seek a review, the committee was advised, and has taken a view that its process must continue as per the agreement between the parties in the matter. The committee has also resolved to request legal advice on the question of oral presentation as part of the process.
