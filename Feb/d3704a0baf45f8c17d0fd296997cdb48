Parliament, Tuesday, 19 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has welcomed a presentation by the Human Rights Commission with regard to the Commission’s national hearings on the underlying socio-economic challenges of mining-affected communities and, directed the Department of Mineral Resources to implement the recommendations. The Commission has highlighted in its presentation that the department has performed inadequately with regard to monitoring the implementation of social labour plans by mining companies as obligated by the Mining Charter. Chairperson of the committee, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, said that the department should respond to the Commissions’ report in the next two weeks and state what it has done with regard to the recommendations and indicate where there are limitations. “The department should also provide the committee with a copy of the response to the Commission. On the other hand, the Commission should provide timeframes attached to all recommendations in order to enable the committee to play effective oversight on the department,” said Mr Luzipo. Meanwhile, Mr Luzipo has reiterated a call by Minister Gwede Mantashe that Sibanye-Stillwater should act with bona fide and work closely with stakeholders to explore all possible options in order to ensure that as many jobs as possible are saved in the process of the company’s reconstruction.
