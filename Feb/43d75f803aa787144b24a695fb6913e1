Parliament, Tuesday, 12 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements today met with the Department of Human Settlements and the Housing Development Agency (HDA) to discuss issues of concern at HDA, which have been in the public domain. The committee was briefed by Minister Nomaindiya Mfeketo and HDA administrator Ms Nosipho Damasana on developments at the entity after it was put under administration last year, following poor performance. Committee Chairperson Ms Nocawe Mafu said the committee was satisfied with the progress reported. She also welcomed the charges that have been laid against the four executives, as this indicates that work is being done to resolve the challenges at the entity. Ms Mafu also commended the administrator for trying to stabilise the entity. “We also appreciate the honesty from the Minister who did not pretend everything is well at the NDA”. “It is important that we all make a commitment to turn the entity around, because its failure is going to collapse service delivery, especially the provision of human settlements, so it is important that we put it into shape as a matter of urgency,” the Chairperson said. The HDA is an entity of the Department of Human Settlements, responsible for identifying, acquiring and developing land for human settlement. It also manages housing development projects on behalf of provinces and municipalities.
