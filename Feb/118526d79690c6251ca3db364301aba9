Parliament, Wednesday, 06 February 2019 – The Portfolio on Police has welcomed the announcement by the Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPSI/Hawks), Lt General Godfrey Lebeya, of the arrest of seven suspects related to corruption, money laundering and fraud in the Bosasa tender matter.
	
	The Chairperson of the portfolio committee, Mr Francois Beukman said that these high profile arrests are an indication of the new Hawks leadership’s commitment to deal with allegations related to organised commercial crime and corruption.
	
	Mr Beukman said that the DPCI’s mandate is to deal effectively with corruption, organised crime syndicates and serious economic crime. The DPCI must continue to energetically pursue this mandate.
	
	“The investigators of the DPCI should be commended for their hard work and commitment to the rule of law,” Mr Beukman said.
	
	All South Africans have high expectations of the DPCI to ensure that allegations of fraud and corruption are properly investigated and court-ready dockets are made available to the National Prosecuting Authority for further processing.
	
	The Portfolio Committee on Police will be briefed in Parliament by the DPCI on high profile cases on 27 February 2019.
