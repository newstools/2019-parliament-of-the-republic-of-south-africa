Parliament, Monday, 11 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture is delighted by the news of the Soweto Gospel Choir’s win of the 2019 Grammy for the Best World Music Album. This is the group’s third Grammy award. Committee Chairperson Ms Xoliswa Tom said: “As South Africans, we are extremely proud of the choir, whose music not only inspires, but also illuminates the hearts and minds of people around the world.” The choir won Grammys in 2007 and 2008, in the Best Traditional World Music Album category both times. This year’s award-winning album, Freedom, was the choir’s tribute to South African icon Mr Nelson Mandela, in commemoration of his 100th birthday. The portfolio committee extends its heartfelt congratulations to the Soweto Gospel Choir, which received this prestigious award at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards ceremony held at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday, 10 February 2019.
