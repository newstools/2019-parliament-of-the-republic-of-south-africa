Parliament, Monday, 25 February 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture has learnt with profound sadness of the passing of legendary jazz musician Ms Dorothy Masuka. Speaking on behalf of the committee, the Chairperson Ms Xoliswa Tom said that Ms Masuka’s immense contribution to the music industry and the struggle against apartheid laid the foundation for the South African art industry. The Zimbabwe-born Ms Masuka entered the music industry during the height of the struggle against apartheid and her commitment to the liberation of the people of South Africa brought hope to us all, Ms Tom said. Ms Masuka passed away on Saturday, 23 February 2019, and while her passing leaves a gaping hole in the music industry and in our hearts, we will remember the beauty she brought to this world. The committee extends its heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.
