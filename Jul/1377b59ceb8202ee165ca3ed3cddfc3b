Parliament, Friday, 12 July 2019 – National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise has expressed disappointment and a strong condemnation of last night’s disruption of the Department of Public Enterprises’ budget vote debate by the EFF Members of Parliament.
	
	The inappropriate behaviour of the MPs was in clear contravention of the Rules of the House. Furthermore, the unacceptable conduct may have violated the provisions of the Powers Privileges Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act. The Act prohibits members of Parliament from, amongst others, improperly interfering with the performance by a Member of his or her functions, creating or taking part in any disturbance within the precincts and failing or refusing to comply with an instruction by a duly authorised staff member.
	
	The Speaker has reiterated that such inappropriate behaviour has no place in Parliament as it undermines the decorum of the business of Parliament and erode the respect and confidence South Africans have in the institution. Parliament needs to sternly demonstrate intolerance to such conduct through a due process.
	
	A detailed report will be submitted to the Speaker by the Presiding Officer who chaired the sitting so that an appropriated course of action can be determined.
