Parliament, Friday, 19 July 2019 – A joint meeting of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services and of the Select Committee on Security and Justice met today to consider the removal of Adv Nomgcobo Jiba and Adv Lawrence Mrwebi from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Last week, the committee received legal advice from parliamentary legal services, where the committees were advised that it is not for Parliament to reopen the inquiry into the fitness of Adv Jiba and Adv Mrwebi to hold office. An inquiry into the matter has already been concluded by the Mokgoro Commission. In his opening remarks, the Chairperson for the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Bulelani Magwanishe, said: “Today we are beginning a process, which was started by the executive, considering the report of the President to remove Adv Nomgcobo Jiba and Adv Lawrence Mrwebi from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).” The commission of enquiry concluded its work and the President decided to remove the two advocates on the basis of the commission’s report. In terms of the NPA Act, Parliament is required to make a decision on whether or not to restore the two advocates. Parliament’s legal services briefed the committees on procedural issues governing the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The two committees agreed that the advocates will be given 10 working days to make written representations to the NA and NCOP. Furthermore, the committees will deliberate separately on the matter. The committees will meet in August to begin deliberations.
