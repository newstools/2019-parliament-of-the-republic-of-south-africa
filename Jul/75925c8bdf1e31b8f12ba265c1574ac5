Parliament: Tuesday, 29 July 2019 – The National Council of Provinces today passed the 2019 Appropriation Bill. This follows the National Assembly agreeing to the Bill at its plenary sitting on 23 July. The Appropriation Bill, which has been agreed to by both houses of Parliament, authorizes the allocation of money from the National Revenue Fund (NRF) to various state institutions to enable its expenditure. This is done in line with Section 213 of the Constitution and Section 26 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), that require Parliament to approve any withdrawal of money from the National Revenue Fund for allocation and expenditure by state organs. The Bill was tabled by the Minister of Finance Mr Tito Mboweni in Parliament on 20 February 2019 as part of his Budget Speech. The Bill lapsed after the last sitting of the National Assembly of the Fifth Parliament, but was revived in June 2019 following the establishment of the 6th Parliament and the revised cabinet portfolios. The reconfiguration of cabinet portfolios resulted in the reorganization of government departments, including the establishment of new ones. This necessitated technical modifications of various budget votes and allocations in the Bill tabled in February. The NCOP passed the 2019 Appropriation Bill without any amendments and it will now be sent to the President for assent. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
