Parliament, Wednesday, 31 July 2019 – The Select Committee on Transport, Public Service and Administration, Public Works and Infrastructure was today briefed by the Department of Transport on its Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan. Responding to questions on the development and maintenance of rural roads, the department indicated that a major part of its budget in directed to three provinces: Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal. It is hoped that major routes leading to coastal villages and rural hubs are maintained to enable communities to access these areas. The committee is concerned that the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has lost critical engineering capacity and is slow in implementing its turnaround strategy. Prasa should heed the call of khauleza and prioritise and work with speed to address issues facing the rail transport industry. The envisaged war room for Prasa is welcomed. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Kenny Mmoiemane, advised the department that the committee should urgently meet with the Road Accident Fund (RAF), as the RAF requires an urgent intervention to assist it to stay afloat and become fully functional. The department should also work with speed to ensure that the new Boards for its entities are put in place timeously.
