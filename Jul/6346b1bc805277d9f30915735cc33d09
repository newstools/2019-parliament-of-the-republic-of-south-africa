Parliament, Monday, 22 July 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has urged sponsors to keep their word and reward the SA Netball Team for its stellar performance at the World Cup.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the performances women teams put on a global stage are indication that SA is a great sporting nation.
	
	“Corporate SA needs to come to the party and avail financial resources. The social impact sport has on any nation needs to be harnessed and could not be downplayed.”
	
	“Had this team not been worried by such things as sponsorships, who knows if it might not have gone all the way in this tournament.”
	
	The Proteas went down to Australia in a tantalising semi-final, whose result could have gone either way. Netball is a major sporting code in SA in the proportions of rugby, soccer and cricket. Ms Dlulane said a revenue-generation model is required for the sustenance of excellence in the sport and that netball needed to feature on free-to-air television frequently, than currently is the case.
	
	The Proteas also went down to England on their third place match. They improved their ranking to fourth on world rankings.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE, MS BEAUTY DLULANE.
