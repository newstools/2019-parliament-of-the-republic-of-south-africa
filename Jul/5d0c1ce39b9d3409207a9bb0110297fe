Parliament, Wednesday, 24 July 2019 – The Select Committee on Public Enterprises and Communications was briefed by the Department of Communications and the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services on their annual performance plans and budget votes for 2019/20. Briefing the committee, the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services said there have been delays and challenges, including budget constraints, with the provision of 100% universal accessible broadband connectivity by 2024. Nonetheless, the project is underway and the department is exploring public-private partnership models to fund the roll-out of broadband on a large scale. Responding to questions, the department said there is no additional funding for the proposed 570 sites for broadband connectivity, however the department is negotiating with the National Treasury for more funding. The committee welcomed the two presentations and asked about the impact of the transfer of three entities, Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) and Brand South Africa, which have all been transferred to the Presidency. The committee noted with concern the acting positions at a senior level in the departments and said these vacancies should be filled.
