Parliament, Friday, 26 July 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources, Mr Sahlulele Luzipo, on behalf of the committee, has welcomed the settlement of R5 billion as approved by the Gauteng High Court to former workers who suffered from silicosis after working in the gold mines.
	
	Mr Luzipo said although it came late, the settlement will bring to end a long-drawn class action case in the history of mining in South Africa. He said the settlement should set an example for future claims to be expedited because the current victory came after many of these workers have died.
	
	Mr Luzipo noted, however, that the settlement was made possible by the democratic order that is reigning in the country, saying the courts could not have entertained such claims under the repressive regime of apartheid.
	
	“We commend the relentless efforts of the legal team that represented the victims and families of the deceased. We believe that justice has finally prevailed, and that going forward, mining companies should always put the safety of workers first in order to prevent diseases that could potentially occur long after retirement,” said Mr Luzipo.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON MINERAL RESOURCES, MR SAHLULELE LUZIPO.
