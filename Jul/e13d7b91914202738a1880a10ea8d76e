Parliament, Tuesday, 30 July 2019 – The Chairperson for the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Mr Khaya Magaxa, has welcomed the appointment of Mr Jabu Mabuza as Acting CEO of Eskom.
	
	Mr Mabuza’s appointment comes after the resignation of Mr Phakamani Hadebe in May, due to health concerns.
	
	Mr Magaxa said: “I am mindful of the dual roles that Mr Mabuza will serve, but the appointment is only for three months whilst the entity looks for a suitable candidate.”
	
	“Eskom is in a transformation process so that it functions profitably, as it moves away from serious operational and governance challenges,” said Mr Magaxa. The committee will exercise its mandate of oversight to make the department and the entity accountable.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES, MR KHAYA MAGAXA.
