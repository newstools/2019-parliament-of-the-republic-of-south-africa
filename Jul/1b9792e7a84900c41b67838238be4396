Parliament, Thursday, 11 July 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has sent condolences to Nkonyeni and Small families on the passing of the two South African arts and rugby legends, the veteran and well-known actress, Ms Nomhle Nkonyeni and the well-known rugby star, Mr James Small.
	
	Both Ms Nkonyeni and Mr Small passed on in different places on Wednesday, 10 July 2019.
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane said the committee was saddened by the passing of the two great South African legends and that the country feels poorer without them.
	“The pain of losing these great personalities cannot be told in words. The South African arts and sports communities have lost a great deal”, said Ms Dlulane.
	
	Ms Dlulane said, the fact that both personalities have made remarkable and unparalleled contributions in their respective fields made the committee happy. According to Ms Dlulane, that was evidenced by the fact that Ms Nkonyeni was a recipient of the Order of Ikamanga in Silver, an honour bestowed upon South Africans of distinguished achievements.
	
	Also, Ms Dlulane said the name of James Small will remain inseparable from that historic 1995 Rugby World Cup final against the All Blacks where the South African rugby squad won. “Both Nkonyeni and Small names will be written in the galaxy of shining arts and sports stars who have gone before them”, emphasised Ms Dlulane.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE, MS BEAUTY DLULANE.
