Parliament, Monday, 29 July 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said: “It is extremely heartwarming to see some of our South African students who left South Africa in 2012 and 2013 returning as young men and women when they left as teenagers and are now ready to tackle South Africa’s health issues and challenges.” Dr Dhlomo was at the Durban bus station to bid students well as they travelled to Mthatha in the Eastern Cape to complete their studies at the Walter Sisulu University. “We wish them well as they complete their medical degree. We are hopeful that they will contribute to the health sector and strengthen access to universal health care and the National Health Insurance for all citizens.” The students completed five years of study in Cuba through the Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro Medical Collaboration and will complete their last year at various universities in South Africa. The programme was established to address insufficient personnel in the South African healthcare system.
