Parliament, Thursday, 25 July 2019 – Parliament’s Joint Constitutional Review Committee today elected its Co-Chairpersons, Dr Mathole Motshekga and Mr Enock Mthethwa.
	
	The election of the co-chairpersons was in terms of Rule 101 of the Joint Rules of Parliament, which relates to the election of co-chairpersons, one from the National Assembly (Dr Motshekga) and one from the National Council of Provinces (Mr Mthethwa).
	
	Co-Chairperson, Dr Motshekga, said the committee will plan out to be the custodian of constitutional values at a time when South Africa has lost its value system. “We trust that through this committee, we will turn this institution into a fully activist Parliament in order to deepen and entrench our hard-won constitutional democracy.
	
	“Through this committee, we shall educate our people about their hard-won social and economic rights to ensure that they enjoy their freedom.”
	
	Co-Chairperson, Mr Mthethwa, appealed to all members to work together in order to ensure they achieve the mandate of the committee.
	
	Dr Motshekga said the committee will study the legacy report from its predecessor and develop a programme of action to take its work forward.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CO-CHAIRPERSONS OF THE JOINT CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMMITTEE, DR MATHOLE MOTSHEKGA AND MR ENOCK MTHETHWA.
