Parliament, Thursday, 25 July 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, has welcomed the announcement of the new Director-General (DG) for the Department of Transport (DoT), as announced on Wednesday.
	
	Mr Zwane said Mr Alec Moemi is bringing a wealth of experience at senior management level, and that excites the committee.
	
	“The announcement of the new Director-General, Mr Alec Moemi, is warmly welcomed and hopefully he will strengthen leadership at DoT. The department is by nature an infrastructure department, and that makes it central to the objectives of this administration, which among other things, is to create job opportunities,” he said.
	
	The committee is looking forward to engage with the new DG on various aspects that are a challenge to the portfolio, many of which could stain the DoT’s legacy.
	
	Mr Moemi takes over the reins at DoT, a post that has remained vacant since 2016. He said the committee welcomed the Minister’s commitment to deal with corruption challenges at the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) and other entities in the portfolio.
	
	“All efforts that are geared towards improving public transport for the benefit of the poor are welcomed. This portfolio should be of service to the people, we are the ones to blame if service delivery is not occurring.”
	
	The department announced that it was also filling 21 other senior vacancies.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE, MR MOSEBENZI ZWANE.
