The Deputy School Principal at Inkanini Primary School, Mr Vusumzi Gumata, has expressed appreciation for the visit by the parliamentary delegation participating in the Mandela Day festivities. “The mere presence of Members of Parliament in this school, situated among the poorest areas of the Western Cape, is encouraging. It is a clear indication that our representatives have not forgotten us,” he said. Parliament is engaged in various programmes to commemorate Mr Mandela’s commitment and dedication to public service. The Chief Whip of the Majority Party and the NCOP Deputy Chairperson led the parliamentary delegation to Inkanini Primary School. Other delegations went to schools in Kraaifontein, Grassy Park and Gugulethu. Parliament had earlier in the morning undertook to provide warm breakfast at various soup kitchens around town. The Committee Chairperson of the NCOP’s Petitions and Executive Undertakings, Ms Zukiswa Ncitha, said the day is crucial and encourages commitment to serve. “We are inculcating the culture of care as envisaged in the principles of Ubuntu. This is what President Mandela, who the day is named after, would have left as his legacy,” Ms Ncitha said. Mr Gumata said he was hopeful that the parliamentary delegation’s visit will be of great assistance and will culminate in the school being built of bricks and mortar. The delegation was also joined by a prominent activist in the area, Mr Andile Lili, who said poverty was real in the area and that the more helping hands there are, the better. By Sibongile Maputi
