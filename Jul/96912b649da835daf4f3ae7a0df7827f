Parliament, Monday 29 July 2019 – Parliament will comply with the ruling of the Gauteng High Court regarding remedial actions of the Public Protector against Minster of Public Enterprises Mr Pravin Gordhan.
	
	In her remedial actions, the Public Protector directed the Speaker to, within 14 working days of receipt of her report, refer Mr Gordhan to the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests.
	
	The court today ruled that the remedial action be suspended, while Mr Gordhan seeks a full judicial review of the Public Protector’s report on the South African Revenue Services Investigative Unit.
	
	The Speaker of the National Assembly, who was cited as the fourth respondent in today’s matter, had filed a notice to abide.
