Parliament, Wednesday, 11 September 2019 – The Joint Standing Committee on Financial Management of Parliament has deferred the agenda item on the briefing by the Executive Authority of Parliament on the outcomes of the Public Service Commission inquiry into the death of Mr Lennox Garane to a later date.
	
	The committee has deemed it prudent that the report be presented to the family, before its content can be made a subject of discussions.
	
	The Executive Authority has undertaken to meet with the family within seven days, after which the committee will then convene a meeting to be briefed on the report.
	
	On a matter relating to the disciplinary proceedings against the Secretary to Parliament, Mr Gengezi Mgidlana, the committee was briefed that out of the 13 charges, he was found guilty on 7 charges. One charge was withdrawn and he was found not guilty on five charges.
	
	The committee has taken note of the fact that the report on the outcomes of the disciplinary proceedings against Mr Mgidlana will still be tabled for concurrence in the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CO-CHAIRPERSONS OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PARLIAMENT, MS GLADYS MAHLANGU AND MS PEACE MABE.
