Parliament, Thursday, 5 September 2019 – The Ad Hoc Committee to Initiate and Introduce Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution today met to elect a chairperson. Dr Mathole Motshekga was unanimously elected as the chairperson by the members present at the meeting. Dr Motshekga said the process is a great step in the deepening of South Africa’s hard-won democracy. “Given the deepening moral degeneration and social ills that are exacerbated by the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality, the establishment of this Ad Hoc Committee will send a strong message to all our people and the world that government’s resolve to address the original sin is fully embraced by this democratic institution.” Furthermore, Dr Motshekga assured the public that the committee will receive and give equal weight to all submissions, and ensure that it will complete its work within the prescribed time frames. “We shall ensure that at all material times we shall put the interests of South Africa and her people, and her economic well-being on top of our agenda.” The committee will meet next week to discuss a draft programme. ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE TO INITIATE AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDING SECTION 25, DR MATHOLE MOTSHEKGA.
