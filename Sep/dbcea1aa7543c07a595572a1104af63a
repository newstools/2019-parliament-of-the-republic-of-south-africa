Parliament, Wednesday, 4 September 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications has called for a harsh sentence for a 42-year-old man who allegedly confessed to the murder of 19-year-old university student, Uyinene Mrwetyana. The committee further called for the National Register for Sex Offenders to be made public in order to prevent culprits from getting back to the employment system, following shocking information that the man who is accused of this heinous crime was an employee of the South African Post Office. “We are shocked by the fact that the crime itself allegedly took place inside the Post Office where, ordinarily, citizens are supposed to feel safe,” said Mr Boyce Maneli, the Chairperson of the committee. The committee, however, has welcomed report by Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams that her department has directed the Post Office to investigate how the accused got to be employed by the Post Office, allegedly with a criminal record. On the other hand, the committee has welcomed a presentation by the Department of Communications about its first quarter performance report for the 2019/20 financial year, under budget vote 3 and vote 32. Budget vote 3 represents the Department of Communications, whereas, vote 32 represents the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services. The Department of Communications has achieved 50% of its planned targets in the quarter under review, whereas the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services has achieved 95% of its planned targets.  ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS, MR BOYCE MANELI.
