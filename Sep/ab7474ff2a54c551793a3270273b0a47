Parliament, Tuesday, 10 September 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation will this afternoon receive an update from the Department of Water and Sanitation and City of Tshwane on the progress in interventions to deal with the quality of water for residents of Hammanskraal in Tshwane. The meeting follows an in-loco site visit to the Rooiwal Waste Water Treatment Plant by the committee where it concluded that there was a general deterioration rather than improvement in the state of things there, with a continuation of pollution of the river system with untreated water from the plant. The committee then instructed all spheres of government to come up with a preliminary intervention to deal with the continuing water challenge. This meeting is to receive both a progress on the preliminary intervention, as well as a detailed medium- to long-term plan to solve the matter. Details of the meeting are as follows: Date: 10 September 2019
