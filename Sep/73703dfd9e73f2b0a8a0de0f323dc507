Parliament, Sunday, 1 September 2019 – The Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs will tomorrow, 02 September 2019, visit Phokwane Local Municipality in the Northern Cape to do an In-Loco oversight visit as required by the constitution, following the invocation of Section 139 (1)(b) of the Constitution. The committee will then proceed to Msunduzi and Mtubatuba local municipalities, in KwaZulu Natal on Tuesday 03 September 2019. In KwaZulu Natal the committee will be divided into two groups in order to cover the two municipalities. The visit follows a decision taken by both the Northern Cape and KwaZulu Natal provincial executives to intervene in the municipalities as per Section 139 (1)(b) of the Constitution. This decision followed various challenges impacting negatively on service delivery within the municipalities. The National Council of Provinces is mandated by Section 139 (2)(c) to, review the intervention regularly and may make any appropriate recommendation to the provincial executive while the intervention continues. This oversight visit is in keeping with this directive. The committee will use the visit to interact with stakeholders including the MEC responsible for Cooperative Governance, Councillors and Ward Committees, organised labour and other forums.
