Parliament, Sunday, 01 September 2019 –The Select Committee on Education and Technology, Sports, Arts and Culture extends its condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the world boxing champion, Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels. The 25-year old Baby Lee is believed to have been shot and killed by her Police Officer boyfriend on Friday, 30 August 2019 in East London. Baby Lee’s mother is also believed to have been injured during the shooting. The committee wishes her a speedy recovery. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Mamagase Nchabeleng said: “This shocking incident has robbed a young woman of a bright future, a family of a beloved daughter and the world of a boxing star." Mr Nchabeleng said that Baby Lee was not just a hero to many women across the world, but shattered the opinions of those who think that females do not belong to boxing. As the women’s month draws to an end, he said, this incident is an example of the harsh realities of abuse and violence against so many women. The committee calls on the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for a speedy investigation and a clear message to be sent to police officers who are often the perpetrators of such incidents.
