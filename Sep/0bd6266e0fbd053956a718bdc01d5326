Mooi River, Wednesday, 17 September 2019 – The KwaZulu-Natal permanent delegates to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) successfully kicked off their Provincial Week programme, today, that will see them visiting distressed municipalities in the province to fulfil Parliament’s constitutional mandate of Oversight and Accountability. Provincial Week visits, conducted in collaboration with Members of the provincial legislature, are a fact finding mission in order to seek solutions to the challenges faced by the identified municipalities. Provincial Whip and Leader of the KZN Delegation, Ms Lindiwe Bebee, said that “part of the mandate of the KZN delegation for this week is to oversee institutional capacity and look at good governance within municipalities and look at ways of improving service delivery to communities.” Outlining the coming week’s programme, held under the theme “Building Sustainable, Responsive and People-Centred Municipalities” Ms Bebee said the key focus areas will include: Water and Sanitation provision, how Municipalities conduct their Financial Management roles and functions, developmental programmes and initiatives, the socio-political and economic climate within Municipalities, how Legislation hinders effective functioning in delivery of services to the people, and the spending of grants received by Municipalities, specifically around Infrastructure. She further highlighted that resolutions will be drafted and submitted in the form of a comprehensive report and with the cooperation of all relevant stakeholders, resolutions will be implemented across the board. “What is also important going forward is a synergy between National, Provincial and Local Government in executing its functions as it pertains to oversight of the functions of Municipalities.” said Ms Bebee.
