Parliament, Wednesday, 11 September 2019 – Having been briefed on the recommendations of the two reports on the Task Team of Members of Parliament Probing Violence and Attacks on Foreign Nationals in 2008, as well as the Ad Hoc Joint Committee on Probing Violence Against Foreign Nationals in 2015, the Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development has resolved to develop a programme of action with clear expectations and time frames to address the scourge. It came out in the reports that the majority of participants in the attacks on foreign nationals are young people between the ages of 16 and 22 years. And it is against this backdrop that the committee proposed for a national strategy on providing entrepreneurial support to the youth, as well as framework on the registration and licensing of all small businesses in the country. Although she expressed appreciation to the complexity of the problem, the Chairperson of the committee, Ms Violet Siwela, still highlighted the need to move with speed in coming up with a lasting solution. “Our portfolio is highly affected by these sporadic elements of violence. We need to take a lead in coordinating relevant portfolio committees in order to follow up on progress made with regard to the recommendations of the two reports,” said Ms Siwela. The committee has condemned, with the strongest contempt, the violence against foreign nationals, and has tasked the support staff to draft, on an urgent basis, a programme of action which will reflect the expectations of the committee and the time frames.
