Parliament, Tuesday, 17 September 2019 – The Chairperson for the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, has commended the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, for creating an enabling environment for the upcoming public hearings on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill.
	
	The department has produced a pamphlet that explains the NHI in all 11 official languages. Dr Dhlomo said he is happy to learn that the department has printed approximately a million copies explaining the NHI Bill and copies have been distributed to all the provinces.
	
	“We commend the department for supporting the NHI Bill’s public participation process in this manner, this assists the committee in creating a conducive environment for the public hearings before they start in the middle of October,” said Dr Dhlomo.
	
	Dr Dhlomo urged people to read the pamphlets so as to educate themselves as to how the NHI will benefit all South Africans, so that when people attend public hearings they can engage and participate.
	
	The objective of the Bill is to achieve universal access to quality healthcare services in South Africa in accordance with section 27 of the Constitution, to establish a National Health Insurance Fund and to set out its powers, functions and governance structures, and to provide a framework for the strategic purchasing of healthcare services by the fund on behalf of users.
	
	The Bill further aims to create mechanisms for equitable, effective and efficient utilisation of the resources of the fund to meet the health needs of the population, to preclude or limit undesirable, unethical and unlawful practices in relation to the fund and its users, and to provide for matters connected herewith.
