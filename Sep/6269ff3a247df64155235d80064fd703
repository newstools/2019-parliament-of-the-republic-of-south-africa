Parliament, Friday, 27 September 2019 – The Chairperson for the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, has congratulated President Cyril Ramaphosa after he was awarded a Universal Health Care Award for the move towards universal health coverage for all citizens, by a New York-based non-governmental organisation, The Access-Challenge.
	
	The award recognises President Ramaphosa’s leadership in moving South Africa forward and applauds the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill.
	
	The Bill is now before Parliament, going through the necessary legislative process of calling for written submissions, and there will be public hearings on the 25th of October in Mpumalanga.
	
	Dr Dhlomo said this award recognises the work the country is doing in ensuring that under the NHI, the government will provide a package of comprehensive health services for free at private and public health facilities as part of its bid to provide more equitable access to quality healthcare.
