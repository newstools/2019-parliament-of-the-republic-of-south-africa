Parliament, Wednesday, 11 September 2019 – The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests met today and elected Joint Chairpersons for the committee. The committee elected Mr Bekizwe Nkosi from the National Assembly and Ms Lydia Moshodi from the National Council of Provinces to be Co-Chairpersons.
	
	The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests is a committee established in terms of Joint Rule 121 of the Joint Rules of Parliament. The committee is established mainly to implement the Code of Conduct for Assembly and Permanent Council Members, to develop standards of ethical conduct for the national Assembly and Council Members and to perform other functions and exercise other powers reasonably assigned to the committee by both Houses.
	
	In accepting the election, Ms Moshodi said “she was keenly aware of the responsibility put upon her, and she committed herself to endeavour to co-chair the committee with honesty, humility and the transparency that is required”.
	
	For his part, Mr Nkosi said: “The committee is bound by the Code of Ethical Conduct and Disclosure of Members’ Interests for the National Assembly and Permanent Council Members, and I commit myself to conduct my responsibilities with fairness and equality.”
	
	The committee as a whole has committed itself to processing all cases before it with speed and impartiality because the code represents a commitment by Members of Parliament to protect the integrity of Parliament, and is a tool to create public trust and confidence in their representatives.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND MEMBERS INTERESTS.
