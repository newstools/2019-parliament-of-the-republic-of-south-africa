The committee will have an engagement with the Elders, the former President of Ireland, former President of Chile, a Norwegian politician and Mrs Graca Machel on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill (Universal Health Coverage).

The fund will operate on the basis of a single purchaser and single payer of healthcare services, by pooling funds and strategic purchasing of healthcare services and goods from accredited and contracted healthcare service providers.
