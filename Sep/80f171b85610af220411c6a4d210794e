Parliament, Friday, 06 September 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) will next week hold hearings with the twelve municipalities that have performed badly in the last round of audits. The Auditor-General has indicated a material uncertainty relating to the financial sustainability of these municipalities. Scopa received a briefing from the Office of the Auditor-General on the 2016/17 municipal audit outcomes. This led to the committee calling the municipalities that, either incurred a disclaimer, or adverse audit opinions in the last five years. Scopa has noted that the material uncertainty from these municipalities accounted for the accruals and payables to the value of R1.005 billion, as at 31 March 2017. This also means that the municipalities will not be able to start any new projects in the medium-term. That is why Scopa wishes to hear from the leadership of some of these municipalities. The implicated municipalities are Mogalakwena, Mopani District, Thabazimbi, Vhembe District, Joe Morolong, Phokwane, Bojanala District, Lekwa Temane, Madibeng, Mamusa, Mafube and Masilonyana. The details of the hearings are as follows: 08:30 – 13:00 14:00 – 18:00 08:30 – 13:00 14:00 – 18:00 ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
