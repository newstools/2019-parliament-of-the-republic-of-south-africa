Parliament, Monday, 2 September 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology, Mr Philly Mapulane has expressed the Committee's shock at the brutal and senseless murder of Ms Uyinene "Nene" Mrwetyana who was a student at the University of Cape Town.
	
	"It is completely unacceptable that we continue to experience the brutal killings of women. We are calling on the University of Cape Town to afford the necessary support, not only to the families and friends of Nene, but to the student community as a whole. We further call on the law enforcement authorities and campus security to work tirelessly towards ensuring the safety of students at all times" said Mr Mapulane.
	
	"We were all hopefull that Nene will be found safe and alive when she went missing a week ago, but it was never to be. A man turned himself into a savage and decided to play God and take away her precious life, a sad and painful reality facing many women in our country. We must as a society redouble our efforts in the fight against gender based violence and femicide"
	
	The Committee sends its deepest condolences to the family and friends of Nene.
