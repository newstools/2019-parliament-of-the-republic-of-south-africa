Parliament, Wednesday, 18 September 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Tourism has learnt with shock of the callous and brutal death of a woman and the assault of her husband whilst they were on holiday at the Hluleka Nature Reserve in Ngqeleni, Eastern Cape.
	
	Whilst the circumstances of the attack are unclear, the Chairperson of the Tourism Committee, Mr Supra Mahumapelo, calls on the law enforcement agencies to act swiftly to bring the perpetrator to book. This incident comes shortly after the Tourism Committee held a joint workshop with the Portfolio Committee on Police on the safety and security of tourists in South Africa.
	
	in the midst of Tourism Month, this news is discouraging for the committee whose focus is on the renewal of tourism in villages, townships, small towns and rural areas.
	The committee sends it condolences to the family and friends of Mrs Kary Turner and prays for the speedy recovery of her husband, Mr Mathew Turner.
