Parliament, Thursday, 24 January 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture is shocked to learn about the alleged theft of R8 million from the Living Legends Legacy Programme (LLLP) account. The committee welcomes the investigation currently underway and calls on the organisation’s leadership and the Department of Arts and Culture to ensure that the guilty parties are held accountable. Committee Chairperson, Ms Xoliswa Tom, said this unethical behaviour deprives the younger generation of artists who are the beneficiaries of such funds, from benefiting from these programmes. Meanwhile, the committee notes and welcomes the investigation into the allegations of mismanagement and corruption as made by the Ex-Political Prisoners Association (EPPA) at the Robben Island Museum. The committee said Robben Island is a monumental part of South Africa’s history and its image should always be preserved.
