Parliament, Thursday, 31 January 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Communications, Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, on behalf of the committee, has welcomed the decision by the board and management of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to put on hold the implementation of Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, as announced on Thursday afternoon. Although noting the fact that the SABC is currently overstaffed and that a number of cost-cutting measures that were put in place did not yield desired results, the committee has reiterated on numerous times that the board should rather find more strategic interventions to address the financial situation, including proposals for new funding models. Prof Mkhize further reiterated the committee’s long-held resolve that the SABC should work with the Minister of Communications to come up with a comprehensive plan that will assist to recapitalise the R3 billion shortfall.
