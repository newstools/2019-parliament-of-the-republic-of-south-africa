Parliament, Thursday, 17 January 2019 – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has expressed shock at the death of a 14-year-old Grade 7 learner who was stabbed earlier today by a fellow pupil. Committee Chairperson, Ms Nomalungelo Gina, has expressed the committee’s condolences to the family and friends of the learner as well as to the school community. “This is indeed a very sad occasion. This young person was robbed of his life at the start of the school year. Instead of looking forward to the academic year, his future is now over.” According to media reports, the incident occurred at the Mpeko Primary School. The alleged perpetrator is a 17-year-old learner. “Our hearts bleed for both families. Their lives will now be changed forever. We want to appeal to the South African population at large to assist our young people to learn the correct skills to deal with conflict as violence is clearly not the solution.”
