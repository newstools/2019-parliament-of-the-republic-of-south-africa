Parliament, Wednesday, 21 August 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour said South Africans needed to pull together to confront the challenge of unemployment.
	The Chairperson of the committee Ms Lindelwa Dunjwa said for the economy to improve; a collaborative effort is required, especially if unemployment among young people, women and the disabled persons is to be reduced.
	
	“This necessitates that the public and the private sectors must pull together in trying to get the economy to create jobs. It is not going to be easy; but we have a responsibility to walk this path together", said Ms Dunjwa.
	
	The Department of Employment and Labour, and all its entities appeared before the commitee; to brief the committee on its programmes and the third quarter expenditure. The committee voiced it's satisfaction and said a lot needs to be done to benefit the poorest of the poor from the department's programmes.
	
	“Most entities seem to be on good ground, but need to improve in reaching the people, and making them understand the added mandate of the department. We will do the work united, in the end it is not about Members of Parliament, but what the country stands to gain", said Ms Dunjwa.
