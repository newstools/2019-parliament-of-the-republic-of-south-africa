Parliament, Friday, 02 August 2019 – The Chairperson of the the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Mr Khaya Magaxa has welcomed the announcement by Eskom on lifestyle audits conducted on Eskom’s senior employees. The announcement came when Eskom released its financial results this week. The presentation shows that lifestyle audits of 365 senior employees have been conducted to ensure that those employees comply with the highest standards of integrity and ethics. The high risk cases have been handed over to the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) for further investigation. Mr Magaxa said the move by the power entity is applauded, but he reiterated that this needs to be extended to board members. Lifestyle audits is a call that was made by the committee last month to the Department of Public Enterprises when the department appeared before the committee on its annual performance plan. Members of the committee called for lifestyle audits on all state owned entities’ board members, as well as directors-general.
