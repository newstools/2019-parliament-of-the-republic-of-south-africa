Parliament, Wednesday, 14 August 2019 – The Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) will tomorrow, 15 August 2019, visit the Amahlathi Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape to do an in-loco oversight visit as mandated by the Constitution.
	
	The visit follows a decision taken by the Eastern Cape Provincial Executive to intervene in the municipality as per section 139 (1)(b) of the Constitution. This decision followed various challenges within the municipality that led to widespread service delivery protests.
	
	The National Council of Provinces is mandated by section 139 (2)(c) to review the intervention regularly and may make any appropriate recommendations to the provincial executive while the intervention continues. This oversight visit is in keeping with this directive.
	
	The committee will use the visit to interact with stakeholders, including the MEC responsible for cooperative governance, councillors and ward committee members, organised labour and other representative forums.
