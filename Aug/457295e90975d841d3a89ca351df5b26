Parliament, Tuesday, 21 August 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has noted the Equality Court ruling regarding the display and use of the old apartheid flag. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the court ruling should signal the end of nostalgia for apartheid South Africa. “At this moment in history no one ethnic grouping should still be missing apartheid and all its symbols. The divisive tendencies of a select few should not be equated to and with Afrikaners, it is a select few,” said Ms Dlulane. “The ruling vindicates the committee’s long-held view that a large number of South Africans, Afrikaners included, embrace the values of a new South Africa, and are willing to help.” On Wednesday, Judge Mojapelo ruled that gratuitous display of the apartheid flag demonstrates a clear intention to be hurtful, harmful and incites harm, promotes and incites hatred against black people in terms of the Equality Act. Ms Dlulane said social cohesion, as promoted by the Department of Arts and Culture, is continuing and that people need to be vigilant on what they consider to be heritage. “Let all South Africans embrace heritage that promotes peace and harmony. The country should be about the future. Long after the rogues have departed, the task to build will still be everyone’s responsibility,” she said.
