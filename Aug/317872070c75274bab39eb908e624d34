Parliament, Wednesday, 28 August 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture wishes the Springboks all of the best in the rugby world cup 2019 in Japan. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane said, all the players know that at this point, it is no longer about individual interests. She said: “The Boks are carrying the hopes and aspirations of all South Africans. The team is led for the first time by a black captain in Siya Kolisi, an indication of the distance we have travelled as a country.” The Springboks will depart for Japan on Friday (30 August 2019) and their first game at the world cup is against New Zealand on 21 September 2019. The committee is proud with how the South African Rugby has kept its word and stuck to transformation targets. The committee will attend the official send off.
