Parliament, Thursday, 22 August 2019 – The Select Committee on Petitions and Executive Undertakings will tomorrow conduct an inspection in loco at the Thokoza Hostel in the Gauteng province. The visit relates to a petition received from Mr Gordon Ndlovu, which seeks the intervention of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) in the claim for reparations and ownership rights of the estate of Mr Ndlovu’s late mother. In a meeting held in Parliament on 17 July 2019, the committee refused to accept the explanation offered in a letter submitted by the City. The letter stipulated that although the claim was evaluated and found to be in order, it could not be proceeded with since the property is on the same erf as the hostel and no subdivision had been done on the erf to enable the award and transfer of ownership of the shop as intended by the Conversion of Certain Rights into Leasehold or Ownership Act, No. 81 of 1988. The committee will also seize the opportunity to assess the issues around service delivery to the people of Thokoza Hostels. Details of the visit are as follows: Date: Friday, 23 August 2019

	Venue: Site Visit, Thokoza Hostel, Khumalo Street, Thokoza The committee will thereafter proceed to have hearings on the petitions which will include progress reports from both the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality and the Department of Human Settlements.
