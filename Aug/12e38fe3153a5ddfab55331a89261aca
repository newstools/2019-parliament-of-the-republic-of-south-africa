Parliament, Wednesday, 21 August 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) welcomes the agreement reached today with the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), in which the parties agreed that Scopa will refer various cases to the SIU for investigation, as Scopa deems necessary. The committee and the SIU are currently developing modalities and operating procedures to regulate the process to be followed in such cases.
	
	Scopa believes that this move will strengthen accountability and consequence management, particularly as it occurs against the backdrop of the amendment of the Public Audit Act, which also seeks to strengthen accountability. As Scopa holds meetings with stakeholders, it will find spaces and areas of agreement in terms of what the committee can and cannot do.
	
	Having met yesterday with a principal partner, the Auditor-General, as well as the Anti-Corruption Task Team (ACTT) and the National Treasury, it is apparent that Scopa is laying a solid foundation for its work going forward.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSONS OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
