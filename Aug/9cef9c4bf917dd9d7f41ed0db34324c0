Parliament, Tuesday, 6 August 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Ms Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba, has said that the shortage of rape kits in police stations will have a profoundly negative impact on solving rape cases and hence rape survivors.
	
	“The shortage of rape kits at police stations will hamper the police’s ability to solve rape crimes, which inadvertently leads to the justice system failing rape survivors,” said Ms Ncube-Ndaba.
	
	Earlier this year, the South African Police Service (Saps) was subpoenaed by the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) to account for the implementation of the recommendations arising from an initial investigative hearing held in 2018.
	
	The CGE’s recommendations to SAPS concerned the administration of DNA testing, especially in cases of domestic and gender-based violence (GBV); poor police enforcement of protection orders; and training for police officers on dealing with GBV cases.
	
	Ms Ncube-Ndaba highlighted the committee’s concern about the rape kit shortages, particularly as Saps had committed to resolve the issue. “Women’s suffering should not be compounded by the unavailability of rape kits,” she said.
	
	The committee will monitor progress on implementing commitments made and agreed upon. The committee calls on the CGE, with its full complement of commissioners, to ensure that Saps accounts for rape kit shortages and that police stations are monitored to ascertain whether the kits are made available.
