Parliament, Sunday, 25 August 2019 – Plenary sittings of the National Council of Provinces, NA Portfolio Committee oversight visits to provinces, committee meetings and Women's Parliament are amongst items on Parliament's agenda this week. The National Council of Provinces is scheduled to have oral questions to the peace and security cluster on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is one of Parliament's oversight mechanism of holding the executive accountable to the electorate. There are no plenary sittings for the NA; several committees of the NA will be on oversight visits. Parliament's constitutional mandate requires that it provides meaningful opportunities and platforms for the involvement of the people in its legislative and other processes. Thus, Parliament is committed to creating platforms of engagement where members of the public can participate in processes to share policy perspectives and ideas to enhance service delivery. In August 2018, Parliament hosted the Women's Charter Review Conference, where proposals were made to cascade discussions down to the provincial level to provide an opportunity for participation across provinces in the Charter Review process. Parliament will therefore be hosting its first Women’s Parliament of the sixth parliament which will serve as a launch pad to kick-start Provincial Review Sessions of the 1994 Women’s Charter for effective equality on Thursday at the Old Assembly Chamber. The theme is ‘Towards strengthening the National Gender Machinery as a response to addressing Gender-Based Violence in South Africa'. About 200 delegates are expected to attend the event including representatives from all nine provinces, civil society, institutions of Higher Learning, SANAC Men's sector and SALGA.
