Parliament, Tuesday, 27 August 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Social Development held a joint meeting on Tuesday with the Select Committee on Health and Social Services. The committee was briefed by the Department of Social Development on the facilitation of the recruitment process on the appointment of candidates to serve on the Central Drug Authority (CDA) board. The committee resolved to restart the process of calling for nominations of candidates to be appointed to serve on the CDA board after the recruitment process collapsed in December 2017. The committee was of the view that the previous processes of calling for nominations will not be disregarded. The committee agreed that the new board should be in place by January 2020 wherein all the parliamentary processes will be taken into consideration and implemented during the period of recruiting board members.
