Parliament, Thursday, 29 August 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation will tomorrow visit Hammanskraal to assess the extent of the poor water quality problem and whether there are impactful interventions aimed at delivering clean and safe drinkable water to the residents of the area. The committee in its meeting with the department last week said no effort should be spared in ensuring that the people of Hammanskraal get clean water. The committee received a report on the various causes of the substandard water and resolved that Members of Parliament must see first-hand the challenges faced by residents. Furthermore, the committee called for a collaborative effort between the department and City of Tshwane if the matter is to be resolved successfully. The committee’s main focus is ensuring that quality water reaches residents in support of the department’s vision of water being life. The committee will use the visit to interact with residents and the municipality, and to measure any improvement in water quality since the matter was first reported.
