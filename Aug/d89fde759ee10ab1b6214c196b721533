	Parliament, Wednesday 21 August 2019 - President Cyril Ramaphosa will appear before the National Assembly tomorrow for an oral question and answer session. This will be the president's first session since the establishment of the 6th term of Parliament and his election as President of the Republic of South Africa in May.
	
	Questions for the oral reply to the President are scheduled at least once a quarter during session time within Parliament's annual programme. Up to six questions about matters of national or international importance may be asked during the three-hour session. The three hours allocated to the session cover the main questions and associated supplementary questions.
	
	Holding regular question and answer session is one way in which Parliament holds the President and the Executive to account.
	
	The six questions scheduled for tomorrow's sitting cover a range of matters including whether the president intends to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture; what are the Government's plans to effectively address the challenge of slow economic growth and deal with rising unemployment rate; what are the details of the persons in the Office of the President and the Cabinet who were involved in the fundraising for his presidential campaign and the potential funders whom he met at each specified dinner as per his reply to question 4 on 20 February 2019, and what has the President found to be the state of readiness of the country to implement the National Health Insurance (NHI) and what will be the benefits of NHI as the country develops the national health care system for the future.
