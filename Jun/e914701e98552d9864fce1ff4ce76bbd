Parliament, Friday 14 June 2019 - Speaker of the National Assembly has responded to DA Chief John Steenhuisen's request that Parliament initiate removal proceedings against Public Protector, Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane, in terms of the Constitution.
	
	Having sought advise on the appropriate way of dealing with the matter, the Speaker has informed Mr Steenhuisen that the Request will be referred to the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services for consideration.
	
	The National Assembly Rules Committee last week established the Assembly’s committee system for the new parliamentary term, and these committees will start convening their meetings from 2 to 9 July to elect their chairpersons and determine their programmes. Once established, the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services will give attention to the request.
	
	Previously, the committee considered a similar request but resolved in February to recommend to the National Assembly not to support the request to expedite proceeding to remove the Public Protector from office, saying such removal proceedings were premature.
