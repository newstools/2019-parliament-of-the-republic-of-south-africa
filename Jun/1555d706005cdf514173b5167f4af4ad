Parliament, Thursday 6 June 2019 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, express well-wishes to veteran of our liberation struggle and one of two still surviving Rivonia trialists, Dr Andrew Mokete Mlangeni, on his birthday today. Dr Mlangeni, who also served as a Member of Parliament in the National Assembly before his retirement in 2014, was born 94 years ago, on 6 June 1925. The nation is honoured to have in its midst one of the few remaining fathers of our liberation, who continue to serve as the quintessence of wisdom, integrity, morality and selflessness. Dr Mlangeni’s lifelong, uncompromising commitment to social justice, democracy, equality, human rights and development of our nation is an inspiring historical legacy that will continue to inspire future generations in South Africa and the world. The love that Baba’Mlangeni has for this nation, the sacrifices he paid and was prepared to pay for freedom, democracy, equality and development is testimony of a remarkable human being and an outstanding leader. Even at his age, he still possesses a sharp mind that continues to serve as a fount of wisdom from which we derive guidance and which constantly rebukes those in leadership never to steer away from the principles and objectives of our national democratic revolution. His active commitment to the service of our nation continues to inspire us to do better. We wish Dr Mlangeni good health, strength and contentment as he enters yet another important milestone of his life, whose significance we honour and celebrate as South Africans.
