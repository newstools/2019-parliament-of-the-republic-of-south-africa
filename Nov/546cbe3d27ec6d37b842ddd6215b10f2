Parliament, Wednesday, 13 November 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) welcomes the submission of annual reports by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), SA Express and Alexkor. The committee is pleased that NSFAS met the 4 November date for tabling, which was committed to Scopa on 30 October 2019. Scopa is also pleased that Alexkor and SA Express made the submission even though they had not made a commitment on the date of submission. Scopa is currently holding hearings with all departments and state-owned entities that have not submitted their annual financial statements for this year to ascertain when they will submit their financials. The committee is very concerned with the bad precedent set by this non-submission of financial statements. This disadvantages Parliament, as it prevents Parliament from conducting oversight over the culprits.
