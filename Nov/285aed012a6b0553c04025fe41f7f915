Parliament, Thursday, 28 November 2019 - The Presiding officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo, have commended the police for their relentless efforts that saw the swift arrest of a suspect in connection with the murder of the 21-year-old student, Precious Ramabulana today. It was reported that Ramabulana, a Capricorn TVET College student in Limpopo was raped and stabbed 52 times in her rented room. “No parent should ever have bury a child; it is too great a pain one can ever imagine. We hope that the arrest of the suspect will ultimately lead to a clear conviction and see justice served to once again send a strong message of zero tolerance for gender-based violence,” said the Presiding Officers. “We are appalled and revulsed by such senseless savagery, which sadly coincided with the start of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign that aims to raise awareness of the negative impact that violence and abuse have on women and children and to rid society of the scourge permanently. "As Parliament, we will never waver in our pursuit of the promotion of human dignity and the rule of law to ensure a just, fair and safer world for particularly women and children. The unity of our nation is paramount to ensure that perpetrators are squeezed out of the communities. We extend our sincere heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Precious Ramabulana.
