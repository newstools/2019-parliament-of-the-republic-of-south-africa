Parliament, Monday, 18 November 2019 – The National Assembly (NA) is scheduled to consider the Foreign Service Bill and deliberate on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts’ (Scopa’s) report on its oversight visit to Eskom, tomorrow, 19 November.
	
	One of the main objectives of the Foreign Service Bill is to craft a platform that will enable a conducive administrative and management framework for government employees working abroad. The latter will ultimately pave a way for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation to establish a foreign service system that will be managed and regulated in a consolidated and coherent manner.
	
	Scopa will also report on its findings and recommendations to the House pertaining the oversight visit by the committee to Eskom, regarding the power utility’s infrastructure projects of Medupi and Kusile in Lephalale and Witbank.
	
	Also scheduled for the day is the Budgetary Review and Recommendations Reports (BRRRs) of the Portfolio Committee (PC) on Defence and Military Veterans; PC on Higher Education, Science and Technology; PC on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation; PC on Sports, Arts and Culture; PC on Environment, Forestry and Fisheries; PC on Justice and Correctional Services; and PC on Justice and Correctional Services on Office of the Chief Justice and Judicial Administration, and so on.
