Parliament, Monday, 25 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation welcomes the Special Investigating Unit’s raid today of Lepelle Northern Water. The raid takes the investigation into alleged wrongdoing at the entity a step further towards finalisation. The raid is welcomed, as accountability is essential, especially for the people of Giyani who are to this day without water despite massive investments in the project. “All allegations of corruption must be investigated and concluded so that if there is any unlawful activity, adequate consequences are meted out. It is unacceptable that the project has not been concluded since its launch in 2014, which robs residents of much-needed water,” said Ms Machwene Semenya, the Chairperson of the Committee. The death of a boy in a trench dug by a contractor earlier this year is testament to the gross disregard for human life that the delay has caused. The committee calls for the speedy finalisation of the investigation and the prosecution of those responsible for the alleged wrongdoing. The committee will continue to engage with the Department of Water and Sanitation to ascertain the project’s completion date.
