Parliament, Friday, 29 November 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, extends a word of gratitude to all South Africans, Non-governmental Organisations, political parties and the interested stakeholders that have made both oral and written submissions on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill. Today, Friday 29 November 2019, marks the last day for the submission of written contributions on the Bill to Parliament. The enormous interest shown by the people in the Bill is a testament about the need to ensure that there is an existence of a healthcare system in place that is responsive to the needs of all South Africans irrespective of their economic and social standing. The committee is of the view that, both oral and written submissions received so far will contribute immensely in making the legislative framework which will lead to the achievement of the objective of the Bill. “At the centre of this Bill is the preoccupation to ensure that there is quality healthcare system that caters for everyone. The quality and amount of written and oral submissions received from the people in Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal provinces have greatly enhanced the Bill,” Dr Dhlomo said. Public participation is the mainstay of the South African democracy and of the democratic dispensation where different views on issues including law making process are considered. It is on this basis that the committee has embarked on a nationwide public participation process which will continue until all the provinces are reached. While the deadline for written submissions is today, the committee will continue to receive oral submissions as it is in the Eastern Cape today at Nangoza Jebe Hall, in Port Elizabeth.
