Parliament, Wednesday 6 November 2019  – Two mini-plenary sessions are scheduled in the National Assembly tomorrow, Thursday, 7 November.
	
	The two mini-plenary sittings serve as breakaway sessions of the National Assembly and the rules allow that any matter may be discussed or debated. This method provides an opportunity for the House to debate any topic without having to take a decision at the end of the debate.
	
	This is done in accordance with the National Assembly Rules 49 (1) that makes provision for the Speaker of the National Assembly to refer matters for consideration in a mini-plenary session, after due deliberation of views and directions of the Programming Committee.
	
	At the National Assembly chamber, the debate will be “Advancing the African Union Agenda 2063 within the context of the twin pillars of economic development and security” whilst at the Old Assembly Chamber the discussion will be “South Africa’s deepening water crisis – challenges and solutions for a water-scarce country”.
