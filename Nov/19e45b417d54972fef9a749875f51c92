Parliament, Thursday, 28 November 2019 - The Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities welcomes the arrest of the alleged perpetrator of the brutal murder of the 21-year-old Limpopo TVET College student, Ms Precious Ramabulana of the Limpopo Province.
	
	The committee said the South African Police Service (SAPS) is to be commended for the work done in the midst of 16 Days of Activism of No Violence Against Women and Children.
	
	Moreover, the committee takes cognisance of the fact the 16 Days of Activism should not be viewed in isolation from the 365 days of action and the ongoing work of SAPS. Furthermore, the committee commends the arrest of the alleged perpetrator in the murder of Jesse Hess and her 85-year-old grandfather, Chris Lategan.
	
	The committee calls for justice to take its course not only in the cases of Precious Ramabulana and Jesse Hess, but in the thousands before the courts across the country.
	
	The committee also applauds the stringent sentences passed in the last few judgements that emerged, life sentences at the most against perpetrators of such heinous crimes inflicted against women and children in many instances by a man that was known to them.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, MS NONHLANHLA NCUBE-NDABA
