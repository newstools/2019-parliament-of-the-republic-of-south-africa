Parliament, Monday, 18 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Health has learnt with sadness about the death of a patient who was shot at Witbank hospital in Mpumalanga, after being admitted for gunshot wounds at the hospital. The committee has viewed this tragic incident as a very serious indictment on the safety and security of staff and patients at the hospital. The incident happens after the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, made a presentation to the committee at Parliament recently where he emphasised that safety of staff and patients in public clinics and hospitals is a non-negotiable priority. According to the committee, the safety and security measures which the Minister Mkhize presented to the committee are not being adhered to, if they are implemented in place. “The department must investigate the shooting and we wish to have a full report from Minister Mkhize as to why some of the non-negotiable variables were compromised and how an assailant entered the hospital with a gun to shoot a patient,” said the Chairperson of the committee, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. The committee has extended its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased patient, and called on the Department of Health to arrange counselling services for the staff members who are severely traumatised by the incident.
