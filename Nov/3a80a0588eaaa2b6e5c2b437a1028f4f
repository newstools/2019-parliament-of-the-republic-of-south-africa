Parliament, Wednesday, 6 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture is happy that its invitation to the victorious Springbok rugby team to visit Parliament on Monday, 11 November, has been accepted. The team will visit Parliament for 15 minutes at approximately 12 o’clock on Monday during its tour of Cape Town. Parliament’s Presiding Officers and the portfolio committee will play host to the victorious team.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Beauty Dlulane said that the Springboks are the “team of the people”, symbolised in their victory parade. “The visit emphasises the significance of the victory that is dedicated to all South Africans, poor or rich, black or white. South Africa is honoured that the current crop of players are ambassadors for the country.”
	
	On Monday, the Springbok team will be photographed in front of the National Assembly steps, beside the statue of former President Nelson Mandela.
	
	The world-beating Springboks brought the coveted Webb Ellis cup home yesterday when they landed at OR Tambo International Airport to the cheers of a huge crowd of their supporters.
