Parliament, Wednesday 20 November 2019 â€“ Deputy President Mr David Mabuza will no longer be able to give oral replies to the scheduled Question Session in the National Assembly tomorrow due to his mediation role in South Sudan.
	
	In his capacity as a Special Envoy to South Sudan, the Deputy President, has had to undertake an official trip to facilitate the second round of consultations and mediation with the signatories to the Revitalised Agreement on the Conflict in South Sudan.
	
	This follows the failure of the signatories to the Agreement to ensure the installation of the Transition Government as agreed on through the peace agreement signed last week.
	
	The Deputy President's apology in this regard was received by the Speaker of the National Assembly.
	
	The next date on which the Deputy President will appear in the NA will be determined.
