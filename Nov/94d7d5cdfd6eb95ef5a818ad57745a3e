Parliament, Sunday 17 November 2019 – A Review Session of the 1994 Women’s Charter, the Commemoration of the 30th Anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Questions to the Deputy President and 36 Committee Meetings, are among a wide range of key matters on the parliamentary agenda this week. On Tuesday, 19 November, Parliament will kick start the Provincial Review Sessions of the 1994 Women Charter in Gugulethu, Cape Town, under the theme: “Twenty-Five Year Review of the Women’s Charter for Effective Equality”. The aim of the review is to take stock and assess the women’s rights regime in its entirety, including all policy and legislative instruments, identify gaps and make proposals for amendments. The review process was officially launched this year during the Women’s Parliament in August and will run country-wide over a period of twelve months. In 1995 South Africa ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children (UNCRC). This committed the government to ensure that the safety and protection of children is paramount within the country’s policies and programmes. Thus, on Wednesday, 20 November, the National Assembly will host the 30th Anniversary of the UNCRC and children representatives from all provinces will be in attendance for the Commemoration. During this day, the Child Rights Ambassadors who are annually nominated by their peers at the Nelson Mandela Children’s Parliaments engage with politicians from various political parties and chairpersons of relevant portfolio committees. They will share the Children’s Manifesto and discuss matters to be included in the next National Plan of Action for Children and how they could have platforms to keep duty bearers to account. Also to take place on Wednesday, the Ministers from the Social Services Cluster will answer questions from Members of Parliament in the National Assembly. This cluster comprises of Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, the Minister of Basic Education, Minister of Human Settlement, Water and Sanitation, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Social Development. This will be followed by a debate on the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill. The Subcommittee on Review of the National Council of Provinces Rules will meet on Wednesday morning. There are no Plenary Sittings in the NCOP this week. On Thursday the Deputy President will appear before Members of Parliament in the National Assembly to answer question. Parliament uses a range of instruments to hold the executive accountable as section 92(2) of the Constitution stipulates that Cabinet Members are accountable collectively and individually to Parliament for the exercise of their powers and performances of their functions. About 36 Parliamentary Committees are expected to meet next week.
