Parliament, Saturday, 02 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Health will tomorrow (Sunday, 03 November 2019) move to the Dawid Kruiper Local Municipality in Upington for the third day of its public hearings on the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill in the Northern Cape. The hearings will be held in the Toll Speelman Hall from 10:00 am. The objective of the Bill is to achieve universal access to quality health care services in South Africa in accordance with section 27 of the Constitution; to establish a National Health Insurance Fund and to set out its powers, functions and governance structures; and to provide a framework for the strategic purchasing of health care services by the fund on behalf of users. The Bill further aims to create mechanisms for equitable, effective and efficient utilisation of the resources of the fund to meet the health needs of the population; to preclude or limit undesirable, unethical and unlawful practices in relation to the fund and its users; and to provide for matters connected herewith. The committee called for written submissions from the public on the Bill at the beginning of September 2019, and the closing date for the submissions is 29 November 2019. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7nq0bSpzEA Detailed programme is available here:
