Parliament, Monday, 18 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture Chairperson, Ms Beauty Dlulane, has called for extra support for Bafana Bafana’s (the national football team) coach Mr Molefi Ntseki following his first victory in charge. The Chair congratulated Bafana Bafana on their narrow win over Sudan in an Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier on Sunday. “The signs are there that South Africa has a right person in charge. All that is needed is to support the coach, Mr Ntseki, so that he becomes one of the most successful coaches in the history of the national team,” Ms Dlulane said. “The South African Football Association must avail financial resources, and ensure liaison with clubs is entered into way ahead of fixtures. The private sector must also come on board, and make this entity called Bafana Bafana realise its full potential.” Ms Dlulane said South Africa cannot forever be perennial underachievers in international and continental football competitions. South Africa has in the past lost to Ghana in an away Afcon fixture. “We wish the coach well, and that he attains qualification for the 2021 spectacle.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE, MS BEAUTY DLULANE.
