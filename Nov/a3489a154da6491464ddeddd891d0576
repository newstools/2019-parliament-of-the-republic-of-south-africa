Parliament, Friday, 15 November 2019 - Parliament’s Presiding Officers, National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have expressed deep sadness over the passing of the King of AmaXhosa, King Mpendulo Sigcawu.
	
	King Mpendulo Sigcawu had been the King of AmaXhosa since the death of his father, King Xolilizwe Sigcawu, in 2005.
	
	“Words cannot begin to express the depth of our shock and sadness of losing such a vibrant leader, who still had so much more to contribute in the development of the South African nation and his people through, among others, the preservation of culture, heritage, institution of traditional leadership and cooperation,” said the Presiding Officers.
	
	On behalf of Parliament, we send our sincere condolences to his immediate family, the Sigcawu royal family and the entire AmaXhosa nation. May his soul rest in peace, Ah! Zwelonke.
