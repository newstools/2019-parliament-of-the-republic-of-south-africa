Parliament, Tuesday, 26 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology sends its deepest condolences to the family of murdered Limpopo student, Ms Precious Ramabulana. Committee Chairperson, Mr Philly Mapulane, said the committee is concerned about the high rate of students that got killed in 2019. The committee is shocked and saddened by the murder of Precious that occurred just when the country is to observe the Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign. This amount of violence directed at female university students, and sometimes perpetuated by fellow male students, is shocking and should be dealt with decisively. Ms Ramabulana reportedly suffered multiple-stab wounds on Sunday night in her rented flat. The motive for the crime had not been established and the police could not say if rape had occurred. The committee calls on law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned and ensure the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to book. These attacks highlight the need to invest in campus accommodation for students, as well as security provision in accommodation facilities that are off campus.
