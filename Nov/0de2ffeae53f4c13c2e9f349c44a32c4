Parliament, Wednesday, 13 November 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has committed to communicate with the Auditor-General to understand the limitation of scope-finding relating to the delay in the submission of the Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA), which has a bearing on the submission of the Department of Water and Sanitation’s annual report. The committee understands that there are significant differences in interpretation between the Auditor-General and the TCTA over the nature of the supporting documentation required to substantiate payments made by TCTA on behalf of the government to the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority and the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission. This difference in interpretation led to an initial limitation of scope finding, which would have resulted in a qualified audit opinion. Scopa has committed to reschedule a date in January 2020 to discuss this matter with both the department and TCTA, as this will give the committee time to communicate with the AG and gain further understanding on this matter.
