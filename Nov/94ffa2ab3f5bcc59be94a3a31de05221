Parliament, Wednesday, 27 November 2019 – The Select Committee on Transport, Public Service and Administration and Public Works and Infrastructure today welcomed the briefing by South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) on its annual report. The committee commended Sanral on receiving an unqualified report from the Auditor-General.
	
	The discussion after the briefing centred on e-tolls in Gauteng, where non-payment for the use of toll roads persists. An announcement is expected from government on this matter shortly.
	
	A list will be compiled of the 68 road projects around the country that are at a standstill, as the committee heard that when projects stall, Sanral loses about R52 million a day. This list will be submitted to Parliament for its intervention.
	
	Sanral is responsible for delivering a safe, efficient, reliable and resilient national road transport system for the benefit of all South Africans.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT, PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION AND PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, MR KENNY MMOIEMANG.
