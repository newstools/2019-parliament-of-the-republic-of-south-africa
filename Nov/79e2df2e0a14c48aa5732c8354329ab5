Parliament, Friday, 29 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Tourism is concerned with media reports from yesterday citing that Flight Centre, the country’s largest travel specialist, has discontinued selling airline tickets or packages for South African Airways (SAA).
	
	This is due to the airline’s financial instability and the risks involved, as the Flight Centre’s preferred travel insurance provider decided not to cover SAA under its insolvency benefit, due to the reported doubts over SAA’s long-term viability. Flight Centre also claims that the government is sending “mixed signals” about the possibility of a bailout. Flight Centre’s decision concerns the committee, as the airline is recovering from a week-long strike, which cost the country millions and has had an impact on tourism.
	
	The committee calls on the Minister of Tourism to lead the discussions, as it no longer lies in the domain of the ministers of Finance and Public Enterprises. The committee believes the minister should call on the President to intervene, as a task team of the ministers involved is required to deal with the situation.
	
	As the peak Christmas season approaches, a speedy response is needed to assure the country and the world that South Africa is still a destination of choice and its national carrier can and will continue to provide services.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TOURISM, MR SUPRA MAHUMAPELO.
