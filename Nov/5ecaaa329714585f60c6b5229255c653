Parliament, Wednesday, 27 November 2019 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has received correspondence today from South African Airways (SAA) indicating its non-availability for the meeting that was scheduled for this evening. This is in addition to the fact that SAA has not submitted the information that was requested by the committee two weeks ago. Scopa is currently considering a legal opinion that it has received from the Parliamentary Legal Services on this matter.
	
	The committee met today and took a decision to direct SAA to submit the required information by next week Tuesday, 3 December 2019. The committee has also resolved to visit SAA next week Thursday, 5 December 2019, where it will meet with the Board, the Department of Public Enterprises, National Treasury and the Office of the Auditor-General on this matter.
	
	In the meantime, the committee will be involved in a process of engaging with the Minister of Public Enterprises in an effort to assist the process to move in the direction of a desired outcome.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
