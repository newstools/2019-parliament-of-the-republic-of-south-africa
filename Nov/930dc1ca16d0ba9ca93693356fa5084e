Parliament, Monday, 11 November 2019 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Adv Bongani Bongo, welcomes the announcement by the Department of Home Affairs that the Minister has signed a waiver which will allow foreign children to enter the country without additional supporting documents, such as birth certificates and consent letters. The move concretises the commitment made by President Cyril Ramaphosa to relax visa regulations to make it easier for tourists to visit the country with the aim of boosting the tourism sector – with the ultimate goal of job creation. The committee has registered its support for this move and recognises its importance and potential contribution for economic growth and job creation. The committee has urged the department, together with sister departments such as the Department of Tourism, Brand SA, and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation to communicate extensively the new requirements, to reverse the effects of the previous regulations that were a concern to tourists. The committee will in the near future engage the department on the impact of the changes to the regulations and where the department hopes to further explore in efforts to have entry friendly requirements that are also able to ensure the security of the country.
