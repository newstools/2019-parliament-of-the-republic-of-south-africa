Parliament, Thursday, 7 November 2019 – The Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Ms Sylvia Lucas, together with the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr Lechesa Tsenoli, will convene a Men’s Sector stakeholder engagement today, Thursday, 7 November 2019.
	
	The objective of the Men’s Sector stakeholder engagement is to strengthen and create partnerships with strategic stakeholders, ensure active men’s participation in addressing and bringing to an end the scourge of gender-based violence in our society.
	
	The gathering further seeks to create synergies, activate multi-sectoral interventions and encourage greater impetus in the nation-wide responses to gender-based violence issues.
	
	The South African National Aids Council (Sanac) Men’s Sector, one of the key stakeholders, will present their response plans across provinces concerning their gender-based programmes. Deliberations will further interrogate interventions already initiated, and address challenges and achievements. A decisive plan of action is expected to be agreed upon at the end of the session.
	
	Additional plans to be discussed on the day include a rollout of municipal Men’s Parliaments throughout 2020, the launch of a street committee campaign (through the leadership of street champions), to ensure the safety of women and girl children in every street across South Africa.
	
	In addition to the delegated members of the Multi-Party Women’s Caucus in Parliament, about 80 participants are expected to be in attendance, including key stakeholders from the Department of Social Development, the South African Local Government Association (Salga) and the South African National Aids Council Men’s Sector.
