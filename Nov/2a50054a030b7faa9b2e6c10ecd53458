Parliament, Thursday, 14 November 2019 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) is deeply saddened by the news of the passing on of the King of amaXhosa, King Mpendulo Calvin Zwelonke Sigcawu, who passed on today after a long illness. On behalf of the committee, the committee Chairperson, Ms Faith Muthambi said: “We are deeply saddened by the death of the King of amaXhosa who took the interests of his nation in heart. We convey a heartfelt word of condolences to the family and amaXhosa nation.” King Sigcawu took over the reins in 2005 after the passing of his father King Xolilizwe Sigcawu at Nqadu Great Place in the Eastern Cape. He was the first King of the amaXhosa nation to be crowned after democracy. In 2010 he was declared the legitimate king of all amaXhosa by former President Jacob Zuma after a determination by the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims, which probed the authenticity of traditional leaders in South Africa.
