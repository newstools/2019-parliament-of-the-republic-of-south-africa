Parliament, Tuesday 07 May 2019 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of the National Assembly Ms Baleka Mbete and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, extend well wishes to the Muslim community for the month-long holy month - Ramadan.
	
	Wishing the Muslim community a blessed Ramadan, the Presiding Officers said they trust that the community would use this critical period in the Hijri Calendar to introspect, reflect, worship and pray for the South African nation, which is undertaking national and provincial elections this week.
	
	"We greatly appreciate the historical contributions of the Muslim communities in the liberation struggle against apartheid in South Africa, as well as in advancing the development of the people, especially those underprivileged, and we trust these commitments to the noble goals would continue to permeate all facets of our lives, including during this period as we usher in the sixth democratic governance," said the Presiding Officers.
	
	May the month of Ramadan be peaceful and bring the renewal of spirits and commitment to build a better South Africa, a better Africa and a better world where all people can enjoy a great quality of life.
